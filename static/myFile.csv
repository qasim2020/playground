p: This is my first newsletter, and I am so nervous. But as the term goes ‚ÄúJust Do it‚Äù and ‚ÄúGreat things lie on the other side of the fear‚Äù ‚Äî I feel it is the right thing to do. Soo shipping my newsletter üöÄ
p: I started learning to code in 2016, on Udemy. It lead me to an amazing community of software developers (<a href="https://getmakerlog.com">getmakerlog</a> and <a href="https://ramadanmakers.com">ramadanmakers</a>). Felt pumped and since that day ‚Äî I am doing things I love. Talking on <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhS951y_K7IE6ZyFP9R9PsylNs4MpcI8i">meetups</a> and writing <a href="https://qasimali.xyz">articles</a>.

p: Welcome to my weekly newsletter.
p: If I had to tell you that you can change your life in a moment ‚Äî "NOW" was the perfect moment, when I am writing this email. I just had a low negative ingress of thoughts. It was a mega push to throw me in to negativity. But, here I am, 2 minutes later, sitting back on my desk and in peak productive state. The magic is <b>states</b>. We can change everything in our life, in a snap. All it needs is to understand how our brain works.
p: Over the following few days, I will try to share how I control my thoughts process and manage to live up-to the standard I have set for myself.
p: While you receive these newsletters, I hope you will also learn these amazing tricks to handle your brain activity. Such as sub-modalities, pattern interrupt, punishment value and much more. These techniques have shaped nearly all areas of my life. I managed to Quit smoking, started learning to code, get a remote tech job, started writing articles and grew my relationship stronger.
p: But it is going to take its time, some practice and learning. Be with me ‚Äî while you commit to growing. Thank you.

p: It was a fully packed week, to be honest. I got tired so many times. And I doubted myself more than ever. The burden to send out the newsletter, meet the videos deadlines, write an article everyday and match Ramadan's pace ‚Äî I felt sad and depressed. 
p: One belief, that kept me going was "CANI" or say <i>"KAIZAN" in Japanese</i>. CANI stands for "<i>Consistent and Never Ending Improvement</i>". Every time a doubt had hit me, I told myself, "<b>It is alright. You are better than yesterday today. Just ACT and Move forward</b>". ‚Äî Every time I acted, I came 1 step closer to feeling accomplished.
p: Nice thing about the CANI method is; it is a <b>single word</b>. Easy to recall when trying to break the pattern. Keeps you in action zone. 
p: I have created these trigger words to break negative patterns. <br> <b>Hammer</b> [ to stay disciplined ] , <br> <b>Remove Doubt</b> [ to prepare for an action in advance ] , <br> <b>Scratch Negativity</b> [ to physically scratch limiting thoughts ] , <br> <b>Show Up</b> [ to readily recover from guilt ] , <br> and <b>Change Norms</b> [ to be ok with staying outcast ].

h3: 1/ Re-designed my portfolio website 
p: My portfolio was dead for so long. Nearly a year to be precise. Recently, when I decided I need to get back in action ‚Äî and after writing ~ 15 days in a row. I got my confidence back. And started fixing it the First. I can see all my articles listed with proper headings. A search bar to find relevant pieces. And gave these Newsletters a dedicated corner.

h3: 2/ Recorded 3 x Videos for the part time job I am currently doing

quote: We cannot predict the value our work will provide to the world. That‚Äôs fine. It is not our job to judge our own work. It is our job to create it, to pour ourselves into it, and to master our craft as best we can. <br> ‚Äî by James Clear
