I just had a low negative ingress of thoughts. It was a mega push to throw me in to negativity. But, here I am, 2 minutes later, sitting back on my desk and in peak productive state. The magic is <b>states</b>. We can change everything in our life, in a snap. All it needs is to understand how our brain works.\r\np: Over the following few days, I will try to share how I control my thoughts process and manage to live up-to the standard I have set for myself.\r\np: While you receive these newsletters, I hope you will also learn these amazing tricks to handle your brain activity. Such as sub-modalities, pattern interrupt, punishment value and much more. These techniques have shaped nearly all areas of my life. I managed to Quit smoking, started learning to code, get a remote tech job, started writing articles and grew my relationship stronger.\r\np: But it is going to take its time, some practice and learning. Be with me ‚Äî while you commit to growing. Thank you.\r\np: ‚Äî Qasim",

We feel people are constantly thinking about us, waiting for our call, going crazy about us, hoping and expecting from us. It is a myth that keeps us stuck to the ground. Embrace the reality \"no body cares\". And take your first step.\r\np: This newsletter is intended to make you feel motivated, that you take the bold decision, and take your first step. Become a little less sad. Feel the sunshine outside, recall the gazillion things you wished you could do. And do them right now.\r\np: I now know for a fact, <b>we make time</b>. We eat when our stomach calls us to eat. Party, when desire pushes us. Sleep, when we are tired. We are doing everything according to our priorities. Yet we convince ourselves, \"time is not right\". \r\np: Time is never going to be right. It is never going to feel like the right thing to do. Unless, we prioritise our dreams over others‚Äô expectations.\r\nh3: My 2nd Vlog\r\np: It took me 3 attempts to record an unbroken video. Just enough rehearse while driving / cooking and showers. Some feedback from family members, they all said it is <b>wow</b>. When I felt it in their eyes ‚Äî¬†I knew it is ok to share it.\r\nimg: good-design-vlog.png\r\ncaptionO: \r\nao.Watch on YouTube: https://youtu.be/j6fvkCTBSpA \r\nao/: \r\ncaptiono/: ¬∑ If you watched it already, let me know how I can improve by replying to this email.\r\nh3: Developers‚Äô Corner\r\np: Make it a priority that what ever you are creating ‚Äî helps YOU.

Even when no one cares, you have solved your problems brick by brick.\r\np: If you have followed my journey, you might know it was zakatlists in the beginning, later it was Medium. I struggled with writing articles on manual and foreign platforms. Now, to solve it, I bought a 5 USD droplet on Digital Ocean. Deployed NodeJs server. Built a CMS, that makes blog publishing + newsletter writing super easy.\r\np: This newsletter is also written in a mac‚Äôs notepad. It goes into the CMS. There it renders into an in-line CSS email template and ships to all you recipients. It also renders on an HTML page, that is easy to share over a URL. \r\nimg: own-cms-newsletter.png\r\ncaptionO: My own Content Management System (CMS) ¬∑\r\nao.View this email in URL: https://qasimali.xyz/life/gen/page/showNewsletter/prioritise-your-dreams\r\nao/: \r\ncaptiono/: \r\np: It is helping no one, but me.

The burden to send out the newsletter, meet the videos deadlines, write an article everyday and match Ramadan's pace ‚Äî I felt sad and depressed. \r\np: One belief, that kept me going was \"CANI\" or say <i>\"KAIZAN\" in Japanese</i>. CANI stands for \"<i>Consistent and Never Ending Improvement</i>\". Every time a doubt had hit me, I told myself, \"<b>It is alright. You are better than yesterday today. Just ACT and Move forward</b>\". ‚Äî Every time I acted, I came 1 step closer to feeling accomplished.\r\np: Nice thing about the CANI method is; it is a <b>single word</b>. Easy to recall when trying to break the pattern. Keeps you in action zone. \r\np: I have created these trigger words to break negative patterns. <br> <b>Hammer</b> [ to stay disciplined ] , <br> <b>Remove Doubt</b> [ to prepare for an action in advance ] , <br> <b>Scratch Negativity</b> [ to physically scratch limiting thoughts ] , <br> <b>Show Up</b> [ to readily recover from guilt ] , <br> and <b>Change Norms</b> [ to be ok with staying outcast ].\r\np: Moving to my Progress üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚Äî\r\nh3: 1/ Re-designed my portfolio website \r\np: My portfolio was dead for so long.

That, to carry forward the productivity of month of Ramadan is possible. \r\npo: My beliefs are changing rapidly the last 2 months. I never thought I could do vlogs as a dedicated hobby; But I made the \r\nao.announcement: https://youtu.be/Q3b3UCA6h4I\r\nao/: \r\ntext: . I never thought, I would believe in hard-work; I did 86 hours work in April alone [not recommended for good mental health]. I never believed I can do self branding ‚Äî but I published my \r\nao.portfolio website: https://qasimali.xyz\r\nao/: \r\npo/: from scratch.\r\np: While reading 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey, I came across this short story of Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. On a dinner night, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet were asked; one thing you have struggled the most over your journeys ‚Äî they both responded, ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù. \r\np: The past two months my biggest challenge has been the same, Focus. I manage to show up and do work. But while in the flow zone, I easily get distracted. It drains my energy. And ‚Äî I tell myself, ‚Äú<i>Qasim you are walking the same path Gates and Buffet walked - it is ok. Keep your head low and keep walking.</i>‚Äù Luckily it helps. Slowly the focus comes back and unknowingly I walk another hour or two.\r\nh3: My first Vlog\r\np: Watching so many people record videos, I decided to give videos a shot. It is less time consuming compared to writing an article. And the outcome is bigger than article [ debatable ]. Found it powerful. And decided to record <b>one vlog per week</b>. This is an experiment where I try to focus more on quality than consistency.

It has improved my blog publishing time [ for example, when I publish my blog to localhost - it automatically syncs it with the Airtable - where editing data is real simple ]. \r\np: Building modules that help nobody but myself - are motivation booster. Because you are easing your own life. You save time. Thereby, become more focused towards your goal [ instead of un-necessary intermediate interruptions ].\r\np: The 3 x developer hacks for this week are below üëá\r\na.Fetch Netlify Form Submissions in JSON: https://youtu.be/v475_BdFTYQ\r\na.Receive Daily weather report in your phone: https://youtu.be/5HBMdBBzpRA\r\na.Automatically Bulk Compile meta tags: https://youtu.be/9EiaL64UlsM\r\nh3: Readers‚Äô Corner\r\np: Their are two books on my bed side table / in washroom / tv lounge / kitchen shelves - 1) The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and 2) 5 AM Club.

      "body": "h1: A small Win ‚≠êÔ∏è\r\np: 2 years back, when 2020 started, I made a commitment to write an article everyday. I wrote real bad. A point came when my wife decided to leave me (she didn't though). Another day came when my friends made me sit in the middle and their wives ridiculed my writing. A group banned me for writing too frequent. People hated me. I wrote not to make a point but to make them hate me more. \r\np: One of these days, Mar 11 2020, a close friend asked me to send my article to a magazine. I converted this article into a CD and shipped it. Last friday, I got a call from publishers ‚Äî\r\np: \"<b>Your article is published in our magazine, please collect the prize money</b>\". \r\np: \"How much is it?\"\r\np: \"<b>5000 PKR (~ 50 USD) for getting published and 10000 PKR (~100 USD) for winning 1st position</b>\".\r\np: I got jolted with utter happiness. Everyone who opposed my writing ‚Äî appreciated it. I felt rich. And things I lost while writing bad, came back. Now, I feel responsible to write, to change us, to spread the happiness, to become someone who cares and shows up.
