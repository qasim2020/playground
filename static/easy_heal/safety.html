    <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>

At easyheal, we love maintaining this culture and take the discussion of ideas seriously. The guidelines below seek to protect the integrity of both.</p>

  	<h2>How to leave an outstanding comment</h2>
    <p>To help you make the most of your comment, here are four things to do before clicking Submit:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Read with your audience in mind: Is your comment appropriate for the community -- including speakers, easyheal staff, and your fellow commenters?</li>
			<li>Revise: Can I make this calmer and clearer? Can I be more concise?</li>
			<li>Support what you say: Can I make negative feedback more constructive? Can I elaborate further on positive feedback? Can I provide sources that support my claim?</li>
			<li>Review how you say it: Does my comment encourage a healthy discussion or is it going to put others on the defensive? The idea expressed in a comment may be a valid point, but if it is combative or rude to community members, it will be removed.</li>
		</ul>

    <h2>Comment removal</h2>
    <p>Although we don’t like doing it, occasionally comments must be removed for the overall health of the easyheal.co.uk community. To help you avoid the frustrations of comment removal, here are some reasons your comment may have been removed:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Not appropriate for the easyheal.co.uk audience: pseudoscience, zealotry, personal requests, proselytizing and self-promotion are not acceptable and will be removed.</li>
			<li>Inappropriate language: chat-room banter, text-speak and combatively postured comments are not appropriate. Calls to violence are never acceptable.</li>
			<li>Response to an inappropriate comment: Please use the Flag button instead.</li>
			<li>Terms of Use violation: We will remove any comment that violates the easyheal.co.uk Terms of Use.</li>
			<li>Monopolizing the conversation: Excessively posting the same comment or link across multiple talks or in response to multiple comments will result in the removal of all comments containing the duplicated material.</li>
			<li>Stereotyping: Sweeping generalizations of any group or individual based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or age will be removed.</li>
			<li>Honesty: Don’t post false information, rumors, or hearsay. If you don’t know it to be true, please don’t say it.</li>
		</ul>

    <h2>A note about comment moderation and our moderators</h2>
