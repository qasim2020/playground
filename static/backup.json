I want to keep these tafaseer and discussions safe. Thus, I am starting this project where I will try to share, How I felt each day's message of Quran. What I felt. If you want to join me in this journey of reading and discussing a portion of Quran for 20 - 30 minutes daily, feel free to contect me through <a href=\"mailto:qasimali24@gmail.com\">email</a> or DM me on <a href=\"twitter.com/punch__lines\">twitter</a>.\nquote: \"If anyone observes prayer in which he does not recite Umm al-Qur'an, it is deficient [he said this three times] and not complete.\" <br> - Sahih Muslim 4:773\nh3: Ok lets Start...\np: This surah is preface to the Quran. If I don't have time to understand the entire Quran. I should understand this surah the least. How it helps me become a better muslim. Does it strengthen my eman? Does it make Quran interesting for me to read daily? Is this really worth it to read it in every prayer. There are so many questions that come to a logical mind. Islam being a logical religion, has the ability to lead me to the answers of these questions. Let's read quran and make it our guide to daily life.\np: Surah fatiha is broken down into three parts by virtue of its message.\nh3: Ayat 1 - 3. Praise of Allah (swt).\np: Allah (swt) is the king of this Universe. This Universe is His project. He takes care of this project. The elements of this project are very dear to Him. He does not want any piece of this project stops functioning. He ensures this project runs smooth. He started Quran by assuring me:-\nquote: \"Qasim do not worry, I am taking care of this planet. You are one of many pieces of my project. I am here. Relax if you are worried. I am here. Even if Satan tells you, you are distracted. He convines you to do bad things here. Still I am here. I am not going anywhere. I am here for you. Come back to me. I will forgive you. I will destine you to success. Because I AM THE MASTER of the AKHIRAH.\"\np: Allah (swt) did not mention if he is master of this world. Because, this world is nothing compared to what is coming next.\nh3: Ayat 4. Promise with Allah (swt).\np: He bounds me to make a promise.\nquote: \"It is You we worship and You we ask for help.\"\np: Even if I fall and fall and go so down in life, that forgiveness from Allah (swt) seems bleak. Dutifully make this promise. Even if faith in Allah goes down. Bound yourself to this promise. Even if you become the richest on this planet, stay firm to this promise. This is a promise handed over to me by my King. I surrender to my King even when I am lost.\nh3: Ayat 5 - 7. Supplication for success.\np: Please guide me to the straight path. The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray.\nquite: \"Ya rubb, (oh God) guide me to the path where I am rich in wealth, relationships, hopefullness, physical fitness, faith in You, understanding of You and bless me with wisdom to speak righteously. Where I am rich. I talk to you and I feel your presence. My actions and words coincide. I feel you around me. I feel the richness of this religion in its entirety. I trust you with my eyes closed. Make me fall in Love with you. Make this life such that I am waiting for the time that I meet you. And keep me from hurting the promise I made to you. Protect me from Satan. Protect me from failure.\"\np: Amen.",

        "body": "h1: How forgiving is Allah (swt)?\nh3: Ayats 40 55 - Invitatation to Bani Israel\nP: In these ayats Allah (swt) tells me that He is forgiving. So much, that He forgave Bani Israel a number of times. Although they behaved worst; they mixed truth with falsehood (something Dajjal is threatened to do) to deviate people from right path, they took the words of Quran lightly, they were deprived of their basic rights by Firown, who killed their daughters, he drowns the Firown to free the people. He sent more prophets on them then on anyother Nation. They wronged the Musah (as), they prostrated to Animals, yet He forgave them. They even questioned the existance of Allah (swt). Allah (swt) strikes lightening on them. They die. Yet he brings them back to life. Allah (swt) is forgiving. He is forgiving.\nh3: Ultimate convergance to ignorance\np: I see Muslims becoming Quraniyon and neglecting Prophet (PBUH). At times, we are declaring gay marriages halal. We at times convince ourselves, it is alright. Some falsehood is fine. Some missing the prayers is fine. Some listening to music is fine. Some doing the wronghood is fine. Over past 1400 years we are now converging to something that Bani Israel converged to. They mixed falsehood with truth. We are mixing the truth with lies. We are becoming bani Israel. All societies ultimately converged to ignorance. They had excess of knowledge but of no use. We have google but of no use.\nh3: Quran or Torah.\np: Allah (swt) tells His people who followed Torah, Zabur and Injil. Who were all children of Prophet Ya'qub. They all were following the Allah. They repeatedly sinned. Yet they submitted themselves to Holy books. But what happens when against their will and wish a Prophet (pbuh) comes to people of Arab. They blatently refuses the Quran? Allah (swt) is angry at them. So angry..\np: Satan is trying to prove Allah (swt) wrong since Adam (as) came to this world. He is still trying. Allah (swt) loves us. He does not want us to break the trust of our Allah (swt). He seriouly wants we disappoint Satan and make Him (swt) proud. But look at us. We do not listen. We do not open our eyes. We do not let the Right path a chance. We are not even willing. We want magic to believe in Him. He shows us magic through Musa (as) at times through Daud (as) at tims through Isa (as) at times by drowing the Firown. We see magic, we open our eyes. But again we disappoint our Allah (swt). He needs us to love him. To make Him proud of us.. That is why He was angry then. That is now He will be angry now. And we do not care. Weather Quran is given to us. We won't change. Weather it is Torah, we won't change. <b>We are not willing to taste the colors of Quran. </b>\nh3:  Mass killings (Ayat 54)\np: Musa (as) goes out of region for 40 days. People on his back, again start prostrating to an animal. Musa (as) receives Torah on this journey. He comes back and sees the condition of his people. He asks Allah (swt) for forgiveness. He (swt) tells Musa (as) to kill those who wronged. So Musa (as) orders the killing of these wronged by the ones who were on the right path. In tafseer it is mentioned, 70000 people were killed in this conflict. Allah (swt) tells He forgave them.\nh3: Vastness (Ayat 55 - 56)\np: This is a whole 1 long season. A long event. One that can not be explained. It is jaw dropping and amazing. Imagine, you are given everything you wish for. Then the one who gave you, you tell him I do not believe you exist. I just can not believe. What will he want to do to you.. Allah (swt) strikes lightening to these people. Who just got blank. Just like that. They went astray. Allah (swt) gives them death. But then Musah (as) asks for their forgiveness. He brings them back to life. I do not know why I take it big. May be because I can not throw light at some body and may be I can not take away people's life. And may be I can not bring something back to life. This life and death is in itself so vast a field, that no body has ever been able to construct life. No body has been able to understand Life.\nh3: In death lies so much..\np: Honestly, in death lies so much. So much will be visible to us. We can not comprehend right now. May be we can comprehend if we realize this Planet belongs to Allah (swt). And we roam on it and taste its fruits and stay 'thank ful' to Him.. It can help. ",

        "body": "h1: Simple tip to be happy and live a life without fear.\nP: In today's lesson Allah (swt) emphasized on becoming a more successful being. Becoming more contented in our heart. Having little or no fear inside us. We act brave and live our lives to our utmost. That we eat to fill ourselves. We move around His planet and make Him proud of us. He was argueed and questioned before sending us to His planet. He was challenged by Iblees. He never wanted we disappoint Him. He wants us to be happy on this planet. Roam around here. Enjoy our lives here. He only wants us to be His representative (successive authority) on this planet.\np: In ayat 62, Allah (swt) clearly stated 3 things that have to be taken care of to achieve the success we are looking for all our life. So many philanthropists. Some say it is NLP. Some say meditate. They all focus on this major part:-\np: <b>1. Believe in Allah (swt).</b> It gives Hope.\np: <b>2. Believe in Akhirah (Judgement Day). </b> It gives gurentee in times of difficulties.\np: <b>3. Be righteous.</b> It is the Rule to live the most colorful life one can imagine.\nh3: What is the rule to by happy?\np: It is 'Be righteous'. But being righteous feels it is tough and troublesome. Righteous means sacrifices. To surrender our will and wish to Allah (swt). To not have love for wealth and this world. To fail and trust Allah. So many rules we have overburdened ourselves with. That only make our life more tougher then it already is.\np: I believe, the basic rule of being righteous is to Enjoy Our Life Here. That is to taste the colors of the most modern religion on this planet. It is to let our women live in freedom where they can ride horses and fight battles and do not give a dime to shackles of the society. Where we are not tied to customs and cultural limitations. Our children love us, they believe we parents are their mentors. A place where we all emerge the boldest | brightest warriors. We do not care if it is a desert ahead of us or it is fire we have to cross to get to our goals. We simply do not care. We are fearless to lay down our goals and hit them. Allah (swt) loves us, He does not put people so close to Him, in a state of sadness or fearfulness. He might lead His people to tests by fire. He even imprison His people for lengthy periods. But one thing He will not do is. <b>Put His people in a state of sadness or fearfulness.</b>\np.note: Guys let us become disciplined. And follow the rules of Prophet (PBUH). Let us fight aggressively to beat Iblees. I have downloaded a 30 Days Challenge Calendar. It helped me and my friends in fighting aggressively with Iblees. We promised ourselves we will not miss a single prayer from Jammat in the mosque. Not even a Single Prayer for straight 30 days. Download it, hang it somewhere prominent in your home, wardrobe, study area, calendar. And place a cross (X) after a day is done. It will help.\nimg: 30 days challenge.jpg\nh3: We are no different then people who were turned to monkeys. (Ayat 65 - 66)\np: Imagine, you live in a village. Nice beautiful green village. A stream flows through it. You have these amazing Trout Fish to hunt from this stream and eat it, sell it and earn your living. 1400 years before a Prophet of Allah (swt) came and emphasized on a simple Rule, \"Do not fish on Saturdays.\" Initially people would have listened to him. But with the passage of time, what would we have done? We would have stopped at fishing on Saturdays. But when we see more and more fish in the river on Saturdays. What would we have done?\np: Exactly same thing the people mentioned in these Ayats did. They dugged holes in the stream to hold Saturday's Fish in for a day and took it out on Sundays. They <b>mixed truth with falsehood</b>. Exactly like today we are whole heartedly doing. Some music. Some missing the prayers. Some dance on mehndi. Some party some lie some crib some ... So many 'somes' that have ruined our happiness.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Looking at ourselves, we need to ask a simple question. <b>Are we acting like a representative of Allah (swt) on His Planet?</b> Why we are not?\np: Find a reason to follow Allah (swt) and let us act like we are sent to this planet by Him. Let us act like heroes and win battles. May be some do business. Some travel. May be we need to enjoy and liberate ourselves. May be we need to act like Allah (swt) messangers.",

        "body": "h1: Islam is not at all our wishes, our desires and self-justifications according to Quran.\nP: Honestly, today's topic has got me moving. I thought having a luxerious life, fitting my needs here in the world is alright. I can live a Normal life just like anybody else. But as I read this miraculous book it has gotten heavy on me. Because in today's subject, Allah (swt) has made it crystal clear. If I follow my wishes and desires, I will know and so will my Allah (swt) know. There is no need to justify our actions by molding Quran. It is not a book that has to be modified. This world is black and white, just by understanding the principle listed below.\nh3: Ayat 67 - 73, Slaughter a Cow\np: Bani Israel commits a murder and they are told to slaughter a Cow to find our about killer. They first laugh at Musa (as). Just like Normal people. Then they ask about how it looks, weather it is virgin, can it plough in field, what does it look like, all cows look a like, please help us. Allah (swt) clarifiyed each question turn wise. They made their own life hell difficult by questioning the will of Allah (swt). Now they find the Cow and finally slaughter it.\np: At least they slaughtered? May be we will say they slaughtered and they are free from the Crime. But then Allah (swt) tells the type of stones.\nh3: Ayat 74, Types of stones\np: I count it as type of hearts. Because in the starting of the verse Allah (swt) says <b>\"Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder.\"</b> So there are different kind of hearts.\np: <b>1. from which rivers burst forth.</b> Some hearts turn to rivers. They build villages, cities and nations. People come and settle near these stones. They are the source of water (truth). The best people who are most beloved to Allah (swt).\np: <b>2. from them some split open and water comes out.</b> The people who are a source of truth but little. They need guidance and when they get guided they give out truth and inspire people to follow them. These people are also truthful and are liked by Allah (swt) but not as much as those who give out light like rivers flowing out of them. They shine but not much.\np: <b>3. fall down for fear of Allah.</b> Then there are those who do not listen. They forbid the command. Take Allah (swt) teachings light. Believe Allah (swt) is all mercy and all linient and will forgive them. They can go their own paths and yet Allah (swt) will forgive them just because they are from Prophet (pbuh) ummah. That they want to enjoy the fruits of life to its fullest and hold on to the wills and wishes of their ancestors. And expect Allah (swt) will guide them to Paradise. They will be protected. So these people will fall like a stone in front of Allah (swt) from His fear. Allah (swt) likes these people also, but when they are going about following their own wishes, they are the worst kind. But still they are not the stones who never subjugate to Allah (swt).\np: <b>Even worse stones. </b> Who do not subjugate to Allah (swt) ever. And they do not harm anyone else but themselves.\nh3: Ayat 75 - 78, Bani Israel and Muhammad (PBUH)\np: Quran comes to people of Islam. They spread the truth. In the way, comes Bani Israel. They take the orders. Distort it. Act like they are part of Islam. And when they go back to their community, they alter it to their needs. They do not listen to orders. But when some of them argue with muslims to prove Quran's meaning is not as Muslims take it, they fell in to bigger conflicts. So in their communities, they advice people who indulge into arguments with muslims, to avoid it. It is not required. Because they inside their hearts knew, Muhammad (saw) is a Prophet and arguing with Muslims will only disclose them more. They wont be able to practice their cultural practices. Like they wont be able to have a Mehndi function at their daughter's marriage. But Allah (swt) concludes, that it is all their own wishful thinking. In real they are listening to their ancestors and not Quran. They are only bending the truth to fit their needs. They know crystal clear what is right and yet they stick with wrong.",

Because I read about Salman (as) and Musa (as) and how their communities perished into their own false beliefs. How Bani Israel (as) took Quran lightly and blamed Hazrat Jibrail (as). I feel, Quran enlarges the canvas of our understandings. It lets you shift your focus from your routine affairs in life to a bigger canvas.\np: In this world's timeline, I am living for a very minute period of time to prove my sincerety to my Allah (swt). That is it. There is no other purpose of our existance. While it is already so small, I should not waist another day on not posting what I am writing daily. So, I am going to publish the commitment of \"reading Quran daily and writing about the experience\" on zakatlists.com/blogpost.\nh3: Clear sign of hypocricy, Ayat 92 - 97\np: People of Bani Israel went so deep into negating Prophet Muhammad (saw) that they started blaming Hazrat Jibrail (as). Tafseer says, they put a blame on Jibrail (as) for all the punishments given to their ancestors and for making Prophet (PBUH) the last prophet. But these are not all of Bani Israel. These are those who are better among them. These are people of understanding. They came to Prophet (saw) and asked 3 basic questions. As quoted in following Hadith.\nquote.font-normal: <b>Abdullah Ibn Salam (ra)</b> heard about the arrival of the Prophet (saw) to Madeenah, he came to him and asked him about some things saying:- \"I will ask about three things that none except a messenger knows;\np.b-left: <b>1.</b> What is the first sign of the Hour?  <b>\np.b-left: 2.</b> What is the first meal that the dwellers of Paradise eat?\np.b-left: <b>3.</b> Why is it that the child sometimes resembles his father and other times his mother?\"\np.b-left: The <b>Prophet  (saw)</b> said:- \"Jibreel (Gabriel) informed about this earlier.\np.b-left: <b>Ibn Salam </b>said:- \"That is the Jews' enemy from the angels.\"\np.b-left: The <b>Prophet  (saw)</b>said:- \"As for the first sign of the Hour, it is a fire that gathers the people from the East and the West. As for the first meal that the dwellers of Paradise eat, it is a portion of the fish liver.  As for the child, if the water (i.e. sperm) of the man comes before that of the woman, the child resembles his father and if the mother's water comes first then the child resembles her.\np.b-left: Thereupon, <b>Ibn Salam  </b>may  Allah  be  pleased  with  him said:- \"I bear witness that none has the right of being worshipped but Allah and that you are His messenger.\"  Then Ibn Salam  may  Allah  be  pleased  with  him said: \"O Prophet of Allah, the Jews are people of falsehood. So ask them about me before they realize that I have become Muslim.\np.b-left: The Jews came and the <b>Prophet (saw) </b>asked them:- \"How do you grade 'Abdullah Ibn Salam within your community.\"\np.b-left: They said:- \"Our best and the son of our best.\"\np.b-left: Thereupon, the <b>Prophet (saw)</b> said:- \"What if 'Abdullah Ibn Salam becomes Muslim?\"\np.b-left: They said:- \"May Allah protect him from that!\"\np.b-left: The <b>Prophet  </b>then repeated the same questions and the Jews repeated the same answers.\np.b-left: At that time, '<b>Abdullah Ibn Salam (ra)</b> came out to them and said:- 'I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His messenger.'\np.b-left: Thereupon, they (the Jews) said:- \"He is our worst and the son of our worst,\" and demeaned him.\np.b-left: <b>Ibn Salam (ra) </b>said:- 'This is what I feared, O Prophet of Allah.\"\np: It was mentioned in Bani Israel books that the next Prophet will be from Arab, a land of Palm trees. Hazrat Salman Farsi (ra) also travelled to this land in quest of finding the Prophet. Prophet (saw) authenticity was now proven and now they are not left with any arguement. They resort to blaming Hazrat Jibrail (as). Earlier they claimed, they will live in hell for a very brief period and will be taken to paradise.<b> Just like some muslims claim, we will stay in hell for so and so time and will be taken to Paradise. Allah (swt) clarifies here that such people did not get any Oath or Promise signed from Him.</b> They will be going to Hell and that is it.\nh3: So where is the hypocricy?\np: In everything they do. They reject every logic given to them. They even reject their own books. Then they start claiming their right to Heaven. In Ayat 94 Allah (swt) clarifies, these hypocrites will never ask for death. Because they want to live in this world for 1000 years. <b>It resonates with what today's Muslim want. </b> We do not want to die.\nh3: Husband and wife relationship\np: In Ayat 102, Allah (swt) tells about the people of Sulaiman (as). They were taught to do magic. They used this magic to create a divide between husbands and wives. The most lucrative thing to Satan. The most interesting topic being discussed in homes. I now believe, <b>the division in marriage has to be the last thing in any Muslim's life. </b> Even when there is anger, do not end up expressing it. Keep quite, leave home and maintain a healthy relationship. Domestic issues pull people down and they end up in misery.",

Furthermore, the Jews repeatedly asked him to respite and give them some leverage. At times they asked to revert back the direction of Qibla and they will follow Muhammad (saw). But Prophet (PBUH) used to pray for them and wished he could show them more signs. In tafseer it is mentioned, he even used to say:-\nquote: “The Jews would have believed if Allah had sent His harm upon them.” <br> - Muqatil\np: Allah (swt) therefore tells the Prophet (PBUH) to stick to the truth. <b>”You will not be asked about the companions of Hellfire.”</b> It clearly told Muhammad (saw) to stick to the truth. Even when it leads to losing the majority’s favor. Truth telling is easy if we believe in Allah (swt).

When he is a tradesman, his enemies respect him. When he is a leader, his people put fear into enemies hearts. When he is bullied, he embraces it. When he is among kids, he is a kid. When he makes a promise, he doesnot bend. His company inspires people. He is not educated.\np: In short, this person is the best among people who I know. If I have to find the purpose of my life, who better person is there for me expect Muhammad (saw)? None. I follow him because he answered all my queries. The next question arises:-\np: <b>Why can’t I follow the One he talked about his entire life? </b>\np: Just because I suddenly became more logical and practical? No, negating the purpose of somebody successful is like drinking water from a glass where there is no water. I believe, <b>Sanity </b>leads to Allah (swt).\nh3: Doubts are fine. Ibrahim (as) also had doubts.\np: Idealising our religion is another problem. We have alienated the Prophets to a level called as 'un achievable'. No body even the Prophet Ibrahim (as) ended up having doubts regarding Allah (swt). We all people are similar. If they were saints and we say, we can not become like them. The whole phylosophy of Quran is challenged. We can become like them. We will stand with them one day, in'sha'Allah. We can become as brave as them. They were human being just like us.\nquote: And [remember] when Ibrahim said, “My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.” Allah said, “What, do you not believe [in resurrection]?” He answered, “Certainly [I believe, I am asking this] so that my heart may be at ease.” <br> - Surah Baqarah Verse 260\np: In times of doubt, the only solution is to hold tight to the rope. There is no other way of saving ourselves. No miracle can convince us. Moses (as) got the best type of miracles. They couldn't believe. What tells us we will believe after seeing miracles.\nquote: Finding the miracles we already have, connecting the dots and after finding truth, staying persistant on it is Islam.\nh3: Why Prophet Muhammad (saw) is a blessing for Muslims?\np: Allah (swt) says:-\nquote: We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O Muhammad], toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face toward Al-Masjid Al-Haram. And wherever you [believers] are, turn your faces toward it [in prayer]. Indeed, those who have been given the Scripture well know that it is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do. <br> - Surah Baqarah, verse 144\np.b-left: Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him) turned towards the new Qiblah without hesitation, accurately facing the Kaaba without the use of any scientific instrument or compass. This took place in the second year after Hijra, the migration. Most interpretations date it to the middle of the month of Shaban.\np.b-left: <a href=“http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/125309”>Link here</a>\np: Prophet PBUH did not wait for somebody to bring him compass to calculate accurate direction of Kaba before turning to Makkah. Neither did he wait for the prayer to finish. He just acted upon it. Sudden and blatent orders, executed suddenly by our beloved Prophet (PBUH).\np: The <b class=\"lavendar\">colorful </b>and <b class=\"lavendar\">bright </b>sunnah's of our Prophet is the real blessing for muslims.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

You do not react to losses, fights and humiliations. Patience gives you ease in hardships.\nh3: Baba ji (Elderly) Philosophy\np: We all have those aged and humbled elders in our homes. Can’t even walk properly. He wakes up early in the morning. Takes shower, wears scarf, gown and warm socks. Finds his crutches and slowly walks to the mosque. It is winter / summer does not matter. He just does everything he has been doing for so long, everyday. Yet, as he reaches the mosque, he is in time.\np: If patience is so hard, why does a person on crutches prefer a hard life over his warm bed’s comfort in chilling winter? May be because patience is not as hard as it looks. May be it is the end product of our Eman (Faith).\nh3: How easy is patience?\np: If it is do able, then how do able is it?\nquote: And We will surely test you with something of <u>fear</u> and <u>hunger</u> and a <u>loss of wealth</u> and<u> lives</u> and<u> fruits</u>, but give good tidings to the patient. <br>- Surah Baqarah verse 155\np: Things really dearer to us will be taken from us. Some of us have already lost them. Lost our car in accident, parents in early age, freedom or say poverty struck us. If your Blood pressure went Up! or it was misery and hopelessness you felt, then it is troubling. Allah (swt) is giving good news to people who have pateince. People who sat back. Smiled and embraced the calamity upon them. Forgot it and resumed their life to their goals while claiming:-\nquote: Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 156\np: .. are successful. What do they get for showing resilience to the loss?\nquote: Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided. <br>- Surah Baqarah verse 157\np: May be patience is a <b>skill</b> that needs mastery. May be it is a prerequisite to a happy life. Like, anyother skill in this world, this trait also needs learning, class discussions, making groups, doing assignments, undergoing small exams here and there. Like a skill is taught in some institute. It is just another skill and it can be learnt. <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/patience-tips_n_5843928\">Click here to learn 5 Tricks To Becoming A More Patient Person.</a>\nquote: Strange are the ways of a believer for there is good in every affair of his, and this is not the case with anyone else except in the case of a believer; for if he has an occasion to feel delight, he thanks (God); thus there is a good for him in it, and if he gets into trouble and shows resignation (and endures it patiently), there is a good for him in it. <br> - Sahih Muslim, 2999\nh3: Rocket science?\np: Heard it every where. Since childhood reading in our books.\np.b-left: Say 5 prayers a day.\np.b-left: Do not tell a lie.\np.b-left: Be calm, be happy and be hopeful.\np.b-left: Expect good and have good.\np: We are consuming so many books, but not acting upon anything we are reading. Book reading has become a race <b>'who reads more books faster'</b>.  More in information, but low in wisdom. We are running with our eyes closed to a dead end. A bigger house, a car, a secure future. Cramped current affairs with their conclusions, references, names of anchor persons, time, location, their affect on future. Our head is buzzing with loud un-necessary noises. We are in a state of a long never ending race.\np: May be we need to stop running and think for a moment where are we heading. May be read less books. Sit calmly with our families. Resort to more patience. <span class=\"lavendar\">Act upon what we read in our 5th grade </span>and stop running on the wrong track.

McKay, Gospel Ideals\nh3: Conclusion\np: Calamities are going to come. Patience or no patience. Everyone of us will be tested.

        "body": "h1: How to beat satan?\np.note: A very dear senior to me said, Iblees has been doing a very hardcore job for ages. He never gets tired. Always working round the clock to set people astray from the path of Allah (swt). Wakes up early in the morning with us. We go to mosque to say prayer. He does not get annoyed. We sit to read Quran, he does not get angry. We do dhikr, he smiles and reassures himself, ‘No problem dear, I know you!’. He just keeps on doing the job he has committed himself to, for an eternity.\np: How does he do that? He is committed. Does not get tired. He has seen Allah (swt), seen angels around him so much so he has seen the Jinnaat around him. If seeing is believing, why does not he himself turn around and start prostrating to Allah (swt)?\nh3: Good point!\np: He is addicted to heroine. He is high on drugs. He is just another addict on the surface of this planet. He is addicted to lies, fornication, porn and corruption just like any other person addicted to these things on this planet. Just like all of us, we have seen the sun lowering to a bleak moon. Ships crushing the waters. Earth coming alive. Nothing is there. A seed turns to a big plant. Clouds throw water at us. Winds brush through us. Animals graze around us. World is a miracle happening around us. But we are addicted to what? Lies, Porn, Corruption and we can not see. Just like satan is blind and he can not see truth right in front of him, We also can not see. We are blind dumb deaf.. Even if we are shown the Jinnat we are so crazy about. Even if we are placed right in front of all the angels of the world. Even if the moon splits above us. Even if the Atlantic ocean splits open and eats Donald Trump. We are blind, we will not see.\nquote: Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the [great] ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people, and what Allah has sent down from the heavens of rain, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every [kind of] moving creature, and [His] directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth are signs for a people who use reason. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 164\nh3: How grave issue is dis-believing?\np: Every single thing inside me, around me, just ahead of me is a miracle. That child coming out of a womb. You drinking tea in the morning. Tire touching the surface of earth and setting planes, trains, world in motion. Electricity flowing through cables. What human can do without friction, gravity, EM field. Can we create friction? Did we create one on Moon? Can we create gravity? Did we create one in space? Can we create EM Field? Did we create one to set bullet trains moving in the air? Can we move a ship on surface? Did we create Beyounce force that keeps the ships moving?\np: We are consuming the laws of nature and taking the nature for granted. Allah swt meetup is right ahead. Sooner then ever, in just few moments we are going to meet Him. Are we ready?\np: We are high on drugs guys. May be a rehab will do the job. Make a 30 Days Challenge to agressively defeat this Addicted Iblees. 30 Days, No missing the prayer from Jammat. Prefer death over Sleep, movie clip you will miss, water you are drinking. Death is better then all these things, if you missed the prayer.. Allah (swt) interview is coming, and honestly death itself will become a grave punishment.\nquote: And [yet], among the people are those who take other than Allah as equals [to Him]. They love them as they [should] love Allah . But those who believe are stronger in love for Allah . And if only they who have wronged would consider [that] when they see the punishment, [they will be certain] that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 165\nh3: Breifing on Judgement day.\np: We are living a life of addict on this planet. Suddenly we die. We are punished in our graves. We rise to the day of judgement. Allah (swt) is standing right in front of us. We get tired for standing for so long. Saying sorry and astaghfar. We prostrate to him. Just like addicts prostrated to Firowen because Firowen could kill them. Now we are standing in front of Allah (swt) and when threat is visible, we are prostrating to avoid this threat.\nquote: Those who followed will say, \"If only we had another turn [at worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us.\" <u>Thus will Allah show them their deeds as regrets upon them.</u> And they are never to emerge from the Fire. <br> Surah Baqarh verse 167\np: We will be briefed of every wrong thing we did on this planet. We will be shown the clips of us ruining lives of our neighbours, consuming intoxicants, clubbing and negating the Existance of Allah (swt).

        "body": "h1: Umbrella of Islam.\np.note: Guys, today's article is a little bit longer then others. Please read it to the end. If short on time, read later sitting at a cozy place.\np: Islam feels like a sinusoidal wave. It goes up and down just like a wave. Following Islam with a persistent attitude feels a little harder. So many instructions and expectations of Allah (swt). One ends up feeling “<b>Embracing Islam at its fullest for me is impossible</b>”. Hard to stay away from music, harder to keep the trouser from touching the floor, difficult to say 5 prayers a day in winters while all the prayers are timed so close. Finally we corner it and declare it another aspect of our life.\np.b-left: Family, Profession and Religion become 3 different groups. Where some preach, each group should be given a different a 33 % share of the day.\np: <b> Today I will be discussing the impact of cornering Religion into a different group.</b>\np: What we end up doing with Islam:-\np.b-left: Make the lowest educated in town, Imam of Mosque.\np.b-left: Send the child to a madrissah (Islamic Center) to make him Hafiz because he failed in other groups.\np.b-left: Side line religion from our routine affairs.\np: What felt the nicest solution to us, we resorted to it. We gave this religion a corner in our lives, where we only go when we feel down and miserable. When we need something solved, can not get it easily, we go to this corner of our life.\np: I feel, the sole reason we have cornered our religion is we are afraid, it will make us do intense amount of work to keep up to the standards laid by Allah (swt). Something that always resonates in my head is:-\np.b-left: A believer does everything to his best.\np: or\np.b-left: A believer is best in everything he does.\np.note: I searched for this hadith and could not find it. If you find kindly inform me.\np: Islam is a logical religion. It does not over burden anybody. Simple and minimal. Emboldens strategies that reduces the work. Organises our desks. <b>Islam does not give weird orders</b>.\np: Imagine one day you decide to turn around. This is it no more sinning. But the perception to achieve perfection suddenly makes your life miserable.\np.note: This happened to me twice. Once in 2009 and then recently in 2017. Miserable life brought me back to Zero.\nh3: Do not go back to Zero\np: Nothing can be done perfectly. This life is just a test. It is fake. Do not let Satan take you away from path. Calm down. Go to work with smile on your face because now you have decided to stop sinning. Open your laptop with a smile, write good work on your computers, take a little shower while going or coming back from work. Fix one thing in one day.\np: People might criticise, <b>“Islam says so and so, you are not really following Islam.”</b> Do not worry, you are on the right track. Islam is not perfection. It goes without beard. It only emphasises on You smiling to your hardships and staying connected to Allah (swt) like a Man.\np: Satan overburdens our religion for us and we end up either cornering it or we start disliking it. It makes us an extremist person, that we start neglecting the meaning of Islam. We become a bad implementation of Islam.\nh3: So how to embrace this religion?\np: Yes, the most important question is how to embrace it. To embrace anything, we need to understand what it is. If we ask the molana (teacher) of our mosque,\np.b-left: “Who is Allah, I can not see Him?”\np.b-left: “I do not believe in Allah, prove He exists?”\np.b-left: “How do I know Prophet (PBUH) was telling the truth. Did angels really come to him?”\np: Such questions asked by anybody makes them blasphemous and they will be punished to their death…<a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junaid_Hafeez”>link here</a>. Molanas of mosques belittle such people. It leads logical people further away from our religion. People who ask really sensible questions, go astray.\np: <b>Most muslims avoid these questions, saying:-</b>\np.b-left: Accepted Islam, now stick to it. Asking questions is dangerous and might lead me out of this<b> Imaginary Circle Of Islam. </b>\nh3: What is the circle of Islam.\np: Islam is everything we do systematically, politely and maturely.\np: Every structure we build after deliberately thinking about its features and dimensions. We design it, we discuss it with nice passionate people. We build it with love for it.\np: Islam is any nicely designed, well thought out written book. It is every tasty dish coming out of kitchen. Anything we give a deliberate thought to before jumping into doing it, is Islam. It is not hastly, badly designed or coded script.\nquote: Think of Islam’s circle as an art. That creates artists.\nh3: Ignorance is also harmful.\np: In today’s lesson, Allah (swt) says:-\nquote: Indeed, they who conceal what Allah has sent down of the Book and exchange it for a small price - those consume not into their bellies except the Fire. And Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. And they will have a painful punishment. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 174\np: According to tafseer, this Ayat came to assure Jews, Prophet (PBUH) is the same Prophet as mentioned in their books. When Jews were told about the authenticity of Prophet (PBUH) they contacted their Ulemas. And Ulema, knowing fully well the authenticity of Prophet (PBUH) told their followers,\np.b-left: No! This is not the Prophet (PBUH) which was mentioned in our books. He has not arrived yet. He will be from among us.\np: These Ulemas were earning good amount of money and respect. Arrival of a real Prophet will affect their businesses. If these Ulemas surrender to Prophet (PBUH), no body would come to them. They ended up altering the meaning of their own Holy Books just to keep their businesses open and running.\nh3: Resemblance of Jews to Muslims\np: A false ulama in our neighbourhood. Good beard, muslim cap on head, five prayers a day, achieved doctorate from university. Preaches about Islam. Gets emotional at times and starts weeping at other times. He is a drama in short. If we ask ourselves, “Will we not follow him.” Yes we will.\np.note: There is a podcast named as Quran talk on all major podcast apps. Android and iOS alike. The molana there seems Quraniyoon to me. He pays no heed to what Prophet (PBUH) said, he only focuses on Quran and gets some meaning out of it. Huge following. <a href=“https://www.podparadise.com/Podcast/Reviews/331535493”>Link to reviews of podcost here</a>.\np: So yes, we will follow anyone around us who seems and acts muslim visually better then others. We will end up following him and absorbing the distorted, ill intended lessons preached by false ulemas. <b>Cornering Islam in our lives, kept us from getting a feel about our own religion.</b> Any illogical thing ever told to us needs to be questioned, searched for and accounted for.\np: Following religion just because, our father and mother were Muslims is no justification. <b class=\"lavendar\">We have to search for truth ourselves.</b>\nh3: Conclusion\np: Islam is a logical religion. It has an umbrella that encompasses all aspects of our life. Whether it is our route to office, our doing tasks assigned by the boss, playing cricket in the ground or waking up next to wife with smile. It never over burdens its followers. It eases things up.\np: I am always worried before writing the article, <b>‘Will I be able to write today’s article? I have nothing to write. Will I be able to do it?’. </b>Initially it feels hard, but as I start writing it, it tastes so good and full of energy.\np: Islam is not heavy. Getting away from evil is not difficult. It is so colorful. You sit back on sofa and smile for no reason. Who wont want that feeling. Islam gives you this feeling in just 20 days of non stop 5 x prayers a day. It makes life fun and easy. It does not teach perfection. Islam teaches us to become <b class=\"lavendar\">travellers, writers, directors of our own lives</b>. It sets people free. ",

        "body": "h1: Stop gambling.\np.note: I seriously read something that is a life changing ayat. All ayats are life changing, but just focus on the context of this particular ayat. <span class=“lavendar”>Ayat 187.</span>\np: I am arranging a tech meetup tomorrow morning (Sunday 19 Jan 2020). While the visitors will be arriving, I planned to keep it musical until all of them arrived. I even tested it by playing some gym hardcore songs in the background. Plugged in the speakers and tested it all aloud.\np: Now I am sitting on a desk, writing this blog. Acting all religious like nothing happened. Sins forgotten, came back to the Holy track. Tomorrow when the event comes, I go back pleasing my audience using all ‘feel good means’.\np: I will be a hypocrite if I do not implement what I read today. Why? Because Allah (swt) mentions in this ayat:-\nquote: These are the limits [set by] Allah, so do not approach them. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 187\np: Allah (swt) mentions do not approach anything which is near the boundary of evil, where you might topple and fall on the other side. If you want to play football, play it in the center of the field. Do not go near the boundary and be a stuntsman. Come back to the center. These stunts might lead you to destruction.\np: Thus, playing music loud out loud, will bring me closer to the boundary and I might topple. This is not a discussion of halal or haram. This is a discussion of staying sane and avoiding areas which might lead us to the other side of the boundary. According to this ayat, things that take us out of the playing ground, have to be avoided at all costs. <b>Approaching.. simply approaching the evil leads to destruction.</b>\nh3: Some things that gradually pulls us down.\np.b-left: Do not smoke a ciggeratte because it is the gateway to other drugs. Not arguing if it is halal or haram. It just leads us out of the field.\np.b-left: Do not listen to music, because it leads to mental dullness. It makes us emotional, we start losing focus and go astray.\np.b-left: Do not look for cheerleaders on the other side of the boundary, you will go out of the ground. Might never come back. Might die in such a state. Might lose the chance to succeed.\np.b-left: Start using word ‘Sister’ when you come across any other girl. I have used it, it really helped me. Satan defeated. My Nafs defeated. Sister defeated. Right where it lifted its head, we smashed it back to the ground.\np: Islam is fun and peaceful. Anything that ridicules our religion. Anything that takes us away from the Core of the field, is a detraction. Following distractions does not make us any better then a 7 years old kid. <b>Our learnings and experiences are useless if we are stuck in distractions. </b>\nh3: Also..\np: Stop looking for fatwas\np.b-left: <b>“Cigerrete haram or halal”.</b>\np.b-left: <b>“Music haram or halal”.</b>\np: Ask yourself, if it affects your focus to your goals, it is just another distraction. Living our life saying, <b>“one day Hidayet will come and we will get back on track”</b>, is a big chance. May be we should get out of this Casino. No body gets rich in casinos. The house always wins. Satan always wins in the gamble of truth and lie. So why taking the chance.\np: Let us get out of the Casino. Enjoy Las Vegas in open. Sit under clouds. Do some coding. Write some blogs. Smile and feel contended. Lets enjoy our lives. Lets stop taking chances..\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Dearest kid taken from him. Yaqub (as) waited for an eternity for Yousaf (as) to return. Went blind. He resorted to embracing the loss. Did not live a happy life, lived a contented life.\np: Hardships breaks us, humiliates our pride and make us humble. More hardships, more maturity, opportunity for more contented life opens. Some makes use of this opportunity and embraces the life as such. Those who do not embrace the reality, who keeps chasing the false perception of happiness, do not really get anything. Such people end up having more dissatisfaction.\np: Believing, happiness is just ahead of us. The next door we open, we enter into realm of happiness, is not possible. Around here, there is always another peak after this peak. Some thing to chase for after every glory. Chasing it whole heartedly, investing into it, compromising the Primary purpose of our life is a not a wise path to follow. May be we should stop chasing the “happiness” and embrace our life with all its defects.\nh3: What is in it for a believer?\np: A believer’s life turns around the moment he starts believing. His eyes do not see hardships as bad happenings. His eyes sees 4k HD Quality movie with pop corns in one hand and Quran in the other hand. He eats popcorns, holds tight to the Quran and enjoys the views. The more he enjoys, the more dearer he becomes to his creator. He is sitting in the cinema of life while rising high in ranks of Allah (swt).\np: <b>Does this movie stop for a believer?</b>\np: May be it does not. Who wants the movie to stop when one knows the reality; <b>’As soon as this movie ends, I will be feeling more contented then now. My creator will come to receive me the moment I exit this Cinema hall’.</b>\nquote: But among them is he who says, \"Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.\" <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 201\np: Believers stayed humble to calamities. Embraced them and enjoyed every second of their lives. Fake believers, cried to calamities. Did not embrace hardships and kept running every second of their lives for “happiness”.\nh3: Solution to a depressed life..\np: Start with 5 prayers a day. As it gets easier and becomes part of our habit, take the next step on the ladder. And then next step. Slowly and gradually. When you feel your each day is better then the previous day, take the final step; <b>’Enter into Islam completely’. </b>\nquote: O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 208\np: Defeat the enemy, defeat the false illusion of achieving a “happy life”. Have more fun falling, breaking and rising. <b>If falling down is hard on us, we are in trouble…</b>\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Poverty on their heads, heads facing down, sun scorching above, desert eating below, feet trembling they moved to find Allah in the emptiness. Stakes were high. Food they do not find, they die. Shelter they do not find, they die. Yet they moved with all risks of losing. They had lost most of their lives. Everything was at stake. One Muhammad (saw) is beside them, they have not seen Allah (swt), did not see angels in real.\np: What moved them during migration? What kept them moving through 12 years of sufferings? Moving is easy if it is a high roof bus with food served on table AC working fine. But when your friends fall beside you, heat eats your brains, death is around the corner, moving is tough.\nh3: What moved them..\np: The trust in Allah (swt) and His messenger (PBUH).\np: Did hardships end in their lives? No. After this phase another phase started.\np: In today’s lesson Allah (swt) instructed muslims to stay steadfast during the battle of trench.\nquote: Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said,\"When is the help of Allah ?\" Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 214\np: The help of Allah is near for people who are facing calamities.\nh3: Simple message.\np: <b>1. Beautified this world (ayat 211) </b>for people who deviates from truth.\np: <b>2. Spend wealth (ayat 215)</b> on parents, relatives, orphans, needy and the travellers.\np: <b>3. Fight the fitna (ayat 217)</b> as it is greater then killing.\np: <b>4. Do not revert back (ayat 217)</b> after coming to the path of Allah (swt).\nquote: And whoever of you reverts from his religion [to disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire, they will abide therein eternally. <br> - Surah Baqarh verse 217\np: Poetry or no poetry, emotional or not, people will follow Allah (swt) with all their energy. People who do not want to follow, they will not. Quran is just a book. Messengers are just people. Satan is just a jin. We want to get lost in fitna? We will get lost. Evading death is not possible.

And if you fear [an enemy, then pray] on foot or riding. But when you are secure, then remember Allah [in prayer], as He has taught you that which you did not [previously] know. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 238, 239\np: Prayers are important, emphasised a number of times by our parents, elders, colleagues, most muslim scholars and now in Quran.\nh3: Protecting our prayers\np: Below are some tips that have helped me in protecting my prayers:-\np.b-left: <b>1. Draw a picture </b>of what we want to achieve in our life and hang it somewhere prominent.\np.b-left: <b>2. Live in </b>your dream picture. Feel it happening around you.\np.b-left: <b>3.

I managed to quit smoking, get over with my divorce and became independent to take good care of my family.\nh6: 2. Think and grow rich  <i>by Napoleon Hill</i>\np: This book made it easier for me to pursue my goals.\nh6: 3. The 80 / 20 principle <i> by Richard Koch</i>\np: It made my days more productive. It gave me clarity of my days, told me to focus on the 20 % of the most productive part of the day.\nh6: 4. Lean startup <i>by Eric Ries</i>\np: It made me iterate the cycle of validating, developing and launching products a little quicker. These blogs are a result of principle mentioned in this book. We have to iterate things faster to make our products successful.\nh3: What is common in above books and Quran?\np: If somebody asks me, <b>what people who write such books on personal growth emphasise upon?</b>\np: They all focus on some key factors:-\np.b-left: 1. One needs to have patience to achieve success.\np.b-left: 2. If one fails and does not get back on his feet, he can not succeed.\np.b-left: 3. Fight for victory, till one achieves it.\nquote: And when they went forth to [face] Jaloot and his soldiers, they said, \"Our Lord, pour upon us <span class=lavendar>patience</span> and <span class=lavendar>plant firmly our feet</span> and <span class=lavendar>give us victory</span> over the disbelieving people.\" <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 250\np: Quran is also focusing on personal development.\np.b-left: Why is it that we believe in all famous philanthropists who have written best sellers in past 1 year, but we can not believe in Prophet Muhammad (saw)?\np.b-left: Why can not we surrender to Allah’s will that He wants us to live a happy and contented life?\np: I think, the answer lies in our strengthened bond to self-made beliefs we have associated with Quran. Recently we were living with Hindus, before that corrupted muslim leaders and prior to that Mongols. Generation after generation we became a mix of traditions linked to these societies. We ended up detoriorating the concept of Quran.\np.b-left: Reading Quran needs ablution. Reading any other book is fine in bed, on floor, in car. But to read Quran we need to purify ourselves.\np.b-left: Learning Quran is recommended after establishing our footholds in society. Getting a good qualification, followed by a good job and finally getting married are considered pre-requisites to give time to Quran. Quran comes at 4th or 5th in priorities.\np.b-left: Acting upon Quran is labelled <b>“religious”</b>. Striving for teachings of Quran is labelled <b>”extremist”</b>.\nh3: Why cannot we consider Quran one Normal book to act upon?\np.note: Seriously guys, writing about Quran right now is so interesting. It is a bright book to learn.\np: Ok. Quran is a bright book. It needs to be understood in small parts, portions, ayats and words. Each time we read one verse from any where in the book, it talks different. Almost all verses talk about the might of our Protector. No one is a scholar of this Book. Some have read it more and some less. But each eye reading it gets its own meaning. You are going for marriage? It talks to relieve you of your stress. You are going for an interview? It talks of relying upon Allah. You are dying? It talks of life ahead. You are happy? It talks of becoming more happier.\np: Just opening the book, opens so many avenues to explore. Reading it, hits our heart hard. Right after sinning, during repentance the hit is hardest. Later it fades and we end up sinning again.\np: Reading books is a good habit. Reading Quran is a good habit just like all other good habits. Keeping the influx of encouraging sentences keeps us <b>alive</b>. Else what use is living, if it is just a piece of meat waking up and going back to sleep everyday.\np: Quran is a light book. It teaches all those things, almost all succesful people talk about. If we can stick to “Think and grow rich” by <i>Napolean Hill</i>,<b> it is equally important we consider “Quran” by <i>Allah (swt)</i> as a good book to read before going to bed</b>. One day read “Reader’s digest”, next day read “Quran” and third day read News paper. Make it part of routine affairs. Do not alienate this book.. It is just another book to keep us live a good life.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Some generations, really advanced, could find the location of angels looking at stars. Some built pyramids. Some build planes that fly. Some went to moon. A variety of men have lived and died. Some achieved great successes, secured huge lands and ruled the planet. Some died a failure. Among all these generations, who is it that really mattered to the Creator of this planet?\np.b-left: People who prostrated to Allah (swt) the most?\np.b-left: People who ruled with justice and eliminated injustices. Did they matter the most?\np.b-left: People who taught Quran and spread its word? Did they matter most?\nh3: Who was it that mattered?\np: <b>Ibrahim (as)</b>.\np.note: I am going to try to picture the situation he faced, using today’s situation. Try to be with me.\np: The present day, we have a good normal life. We have secured financial stability. Our parents, wife and kids are living a fine life. Kids will get good education, parents will get good treatment in hospitals and wife will get good freedom. Everything is normal in any normal person’s life.\np: Making it abnormal would be a chaos. It will be a down hill run and no coming back. <b>Raising voice for injustice happening somewhere out in the courts</b> would be abnormal. Trying to feed a kid for lifetime while<b> compromising my own kids studies</b> would be abnormal. <b>Selling all of our savings out and giving it in sadaqah</b> is abnormal. <b>Fighting to protect the underprivileged</b> in a normal life would be abnormal.\np: Running down this path of abnormality is not recommended, not allowed. Dying in the path of Allah is not <b>recommended</b> by our relatives and friends. Shahadat (Martyrdom) is considered a loss to a young wife. Praying for it, or saying to achieve it out loud, is bad.\nh3: Lets say, someone raises his voice for justice in an unjust society. What will happen?\np: He will be kicked out the 1st day from his home. He will run around for protection out in the open. No one will give him protection if he keeps acting “abnormal”.\np: He will break down and fall, may be tomorrow or some days ahead. He will surrender to the norms of society. He will try to act a little normal that he is given a shelter and survive.\np: If he sticks to “<b>raising voice against injustice</b>” and “<b>does not settle for any less he determined to</b>”, he will be attacked harder by people in power. His own relatives first, followed by colleagues and neighbours will try to pull him down out of “<b>love for his wellbeing</b>”.\nh3: Still if he does not give up?\np: He will be taken to asylum cells. May be given electric shocks. He will be put behind bars. He will be made bedridden forcefully. He will be dented to fit in the definition of a<b> ‘Normal Life’</b>.\nh3: Who was Ibrahim (as)?\np: Ibrahim (as) was somebody who after the electric shocks, the phase behind bars and the hard hitting; did not settle. He kept on running towards the fire, was thrown into it. He was made to question his own sanity. Just a dream, made him put his own son down for “straight to the point”, ”no questions asked” sacrifice.\np: From being the <b>only 1</b> on this planet to believe in the might of Allah (swt), he made it to <b>1.8 Billion people</b> believing in the might of Creator. We face the stone, he moved. We face the city, he built. We love the sacrifice, he made. Our Prophet went into isolation to find Allah, Ibrahim found. He looked towards Allah (swt) to make the Kaaba, a Kibla, Ibrahim built.\nh3: How hard did Ibrahim (as) fight?\np: Some beaten, declared abnormal goes to Chief Justice of some state and questions his credibility. He will be humiliated, threatened and pushed further lower. Ibrahim (as) did not go to Chief Justice. He went straight to the ruler ‘Namrood’. Ibrahim (as) had neither power nor reputation to settle an argument with him. He straight on went into questioning his credibility.\nquote: Have you not considered the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord [merely] because Allah had given him kingship? When Abraham said, \"My Lord is the one who gives life and causes death,\" he said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Abraham said, \"Indeed, Allah brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.\" So the disbeliever was overwhelmed [by astonishment], and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. <br>- Surah Baqarah verse 258\np: More sufferings his way. Did he give up? Did he not fall into fire for Allah (swt)? Did he not lay his own son a sacrifice? Did he not settle for nothing but truth?\np: Somebody did it for the love of Allah (swt). Where do I stand? After saying 5 prayers and writing articles and talking high. Still at 0. My worth? Like anybody’s worth, is 0 when it comes to comparing my superficial love with Ibrahim (as)’s love.\np: <b>May Allah (swt) accept our efforts and make us brave enough that we follow the path of Ibrahim (as). <span class=lavendar>May we make our Creator proud of us..</span> Amen </b>\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Quran is a wonder\np: Allah (swt) mentions these rules without error. He took some time establishing these laws. I do not know the sequence of Allah’s creations, but He made the system very delicately. Humans are put on this planet, dependant on physical laws to survive. Water, air, earth, sand are designed to keep humans alive.\nh3: What is next in His creations?\np: He made the intelligence; <b>“self evolving”, “exploring itself” </b>and<b> “finding the existence of our Creator”</b>. We are already moving towards our Creator (swt). Trying to find Him around us. Not all of us. But some entrepreneurs, passionate youngsters who are looking for purpose, are on the path of self discovery. Travelling around, getting a hint of Allah’s existence.\np: We super intelligent creatures <b>“finding the purpose of our lives”</b> is not it. <b>\"Keeping us alive”</b> is not the end of Allah’s creations.\np: <b>It does not end here.</b>\np: We are bound by laws, rules, limits and orders to keep ourselves from hitting destruction of ourselves and this planet. These laws are written quite comprehensively, thoroughly thought out and planned by the Creator.\np: Laws can not be challenged and limits if bypassed, hurts us.\np: Sometimes challenging these laws make us frustrated, angry and depressed. Other times it leads us to a rabbit hole of failures. One failure after another and we are stuck, can’t get out.\nh3: Just imagine..\np: First the creator, created us. He created earth. Sky above, Stars further above. Universe some where higher. Black holes. Far far above, He created another sky. That sky is now sky number 2. Then there are 7 such skies. Higher He established His own throne. So far higher He sits Himself. Now He is there on His throne. Yet He is closer to us. That tells, He is biggest (Allah is Akbar). Really big.\np: Now after all these creations, he writes about how to give divorce to our women. How if we die, our women to sit protected for 4 months and 10 days, the time before which the pregnancy is determined. Another rule He writes, if we divorce our wife, she can not return to us, until she marries somebody else. Another rule He writes, if we divorce our wives, we should provide for the mother and mother to feed the child until child is 2 years old. Or do not feed the child if we mutually agree upon terminating it. Or we can ask someone else to feed our child for us, if we agree upon it.\np.note: Surah Baqarah verses 230 - 237\nh3: Connecting the dots\np: Creation of this planet is an un-explainable wonder. Makes us sit in awe. Initially He made us. Then He kept us alive by providing physical laws. Then He gave us a manual to function properly.\np: All to ensure; we do not create fuss on His planet. We keep ourselves in our senses and spread goodness around. We do not harm each other. All to ensure, <b>we keep His planet from getting dirtier</b>.\nh3: Can somebody do this?\np.b-left: Create a planet just like earth.\np.b-left: Create a manual to walk on this planet parallel to Quran.\np: No one has done it so far. Constitutions were written by Romans. They failed. By Persians, they also failed. So many books written so far, all failed. <b class=‘lavender’>Why did Quran not fail?</b>\np: Because it is a wonder. Just like earth is a wonder, Quran is a wonder. It can not fail.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Getting really wealthy while following Quran\np.note: Guys, today I am going to speak, like I am speaking to my younger brother. I managed to become really rich in material by walking on this path. I really want we all live in an enlightened world where we are free of financial problems.\np: We all agree that Muhammad (saw) was the most successful person ever on earth. He was having a good life. His wives were happy with him. His followers used to admire him. Till today he is quoted as the most influential person in history. His trade was successful. Battles were also a success. During Treaty of Hudaiybia, he was opposed by the closest to him, yet his sole decision-making lead entire state of Madina conquer Mecca. No blood was shed. People during invasion were feeling satisfied. Disbelievers from Mecca were also terrified at first, but later as Muslims won the city of Mecca, they were relieved. No one was harmed. People were guaranteed a safe life. Some were known for torturing muslims but they were forgiven. It was a delightful journey for Prophet Muhammad (saw) and all muslims.\np: Muhammad (saw) was really a successful person. He faced few hardships here and there. But he fought with courage and stood his ground. He lived a contented life and enjoyed the wealthiest life on earth.\np: I honestly believe we should follow Muhammad (saw) to solve all our problems. Even if we want to get rich in material today, Muhammad (saw) was a fine tradesman to follow. His investments bore fruit and he won the wealthiest woman in Mecca, Hazrat Khadija (ra).\nh3: Marriage of Muhammad (saw) with Khadija (ra)\np: Muhammad (saw) was an illiterate man at the age of 25 when he married Hazrat Khadija (ra). Hazrat Khadija (ra) was a really wealthy woman at the time of her marriage. Her own caravan for trades to Syria surpassed all other caravans of Qurayesh.\np: She was not used to travelling with her own caravans and preferred sending somebody else to represent her in her trade. In 595, Khadijah (ra) needed a co-worker for a transaction in Syria. She chose Muhammad ibn Abdullah for the trade in Syria. With the permission of Abu Talib ibn Muttalib, his uncle, he was sent to Syria with one of Khadijah's servants, Maysarah.\np: The caravan after returning from Syria, got double the profit Khadija (ra) had expected. Her servant Maysarah told Khadija (ra) about the honesty, trust worthiness and truthfulness of Muhammad (saw). The success of caravan earned Muhammad (saw) the titles of “Al Sadiq” and “Al Amin”. Khadija (ra) admired the honesty of Muhammad (saw) and asked for his hand. They got married.\nh3: Should we marry a wealthy lady to get rich?\np: Yes if we find one, we should. But what about people who are already married. Also what about people who do not have a choice but to marry someone from not-so-rich family.\np: Muhammad (saw)’s life before Prophethood emphasises on two key aspects.\np.b-left: 1. He was truthful in his affairs.\np.b-left: 2. He was trust worthy that he would never break his promises.\np: Financial well-being is directly linked with our personal preferences. If we are not so trust worthy people, we might not get rich sooner. It will take a lot of time to convince people to invest in our ideas. However, if we become trustworthy and truthful, people will start listening to us. We will get good connections and we will get rich sooner. This is a very simple rule of life. <b>Honest shop keepers earn more then dishonest shopkeepers.</b>\nh3: Honesty.. Is it that simple?\np: Honesty is a very difficult trait to adopt. Just like patience and discipline. All these good traits that make us rich are comparatively difficult to embrace. In order to become honest and trust worthy we need to work on some major aspects of our life.\np.b-left: 1. Make ourself purer 5 times a day. Start saying all 5 prayers.\np.b-left: 2. Write some baseline rules on a piece of paper and do not compromise on these rules.\np.b-left: 3. Control impulsive reaction to situations. Listen, digest and respond in a low voice maturely.\np: These all things actually are one thing. It is to become a good person who lives a happy life. If we really want to get out of financial burden, we need to fix our own selves. Avoid following desires for some time, may be a month. Once we are on track, our desires will superimpose our habits. We will start living a purer and brighter day. Every morning will become better than the previous morning.\np: Step by step we will become more richer in our life. We are not bad people ourselves. We are just afraid of loss while making bolder decisions. Less risks less fun. More risks more adventure.\nh3: After achieving honest, invest boldly\np.note: This part is important, be with me..\np: Being honest will make us fearless. We develop a habit of talking truth and putting our reputation at stake more often. As we tame our fears, we become courageous to face our fears. Just like we tamed our fear of losing reputation by becoming honest and truthful, <span class=lavendar>we have to tame our next big fear; <b>”losing stability while investing money”.</b> </span>\np: The fear of losing stability in our life, stops us from investing in our bold ideas. These ideas are mostly million dollar ideas never acted upon due to fear of poverty. But as we start investing more, our investments start bearing fruits. Some times we lose a little, but the good relationships and trust we have developed through being honest, compliments our losses. It becomes easier to lose sometimes and win sometimes.\nquote: Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 268\nh3: How much time to get rich?\np: If we change today, in a month we will have better health. 2 months, better food on table. 3 months, better relationships. 4 months, better home. 5 months, better life. 1 or 2 years down this road, an ideal home where everything is perfect. Some say, this world never gets perfect. They are wrong. People who have better health, better relationships and a better car really do not live a bad life.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: A balanced society\np: Muslims ruled the word from 7th to 13th century. Baghdad became the richest state in the world. Ruler of muslim caliphate, <b>Harun al Rashid</b> had established ‘House of wisdom’ to translate Greek knowledge to Arabic, where Jews, Christians and Muslims worked side by side to translate as much knowledge into native arabic as it was possible. Books printing press was established to address excessive demand of books around the world. Baghdad was the center of all new discoveries. It went on for around 600 years and muslims fell into their own pit of ‘comfort’ and ‘luxury’. We fell and since then we are fighting to get back up on our feet.\nh3: Was that society of Harun al Rashid a balanced society?\np: I believe, it was blessed with enormous riches. Allah (swt) had blessed the state with stability. It was a good life in Baghdad, around Baghdad uptil Spain and Subcontinent. Almost all areas encompassed by muslims were flourishing. Uptil year 1300, muslims resorted to use of gold, coin and silver dinars. Currency had an intrinsic value which made it easier for system to run in an orderly fashion. It was a prospering state.\np: Yes, it was a <b>balanced declining society</b>. Balanced, because interest based systems had not yet found their way into the state run systems. Declining, because rulers became more focused on luxury and comfort as time passed.\nh3: Not declining but balanced society?\np: The true balanced society existed around 100 years before. People in 800 were eating the fruits of hardships pored in by people from 610 to 660s. Rightly guided caliphs up-till Hazrat Ali (ra) had established a system of money circulation. Poor were regularly pushed with zakat and state-extended benefits. Rich were focused on boosting their businesses. From government employees to low literate people everyone was investing in his own endeavour / trade. Interest based systems of Persians and Romans were collapsing while society based on entrepreneurial spirit was progressing rapidly.\np: It is believed there came a time when people in Madina failed to find zakat eligible people. They resorted to getting out of city to find such people. Such systems created a balanced society.\nh3: Creation of banking system and usury\np: Banks were created far back in history in around 2000 BC. The concept behind banking system is to provide security to people’s finances. Banks usually work on following lines:-\np.b-left: 1. They provide<b> guarantee</b> to society on behalf of people dependant on them.\np.b-left: 2. Banks give us a <b>receipt</b> to make payments on their behalf.\np.b-left: 3. Banks being richer, rather richest<b> control</b> all those who are dependant on them.\np: To understand working of banks, consider them any rich guy around us. We are in trouble, we go to this person. He takes some fee to extend us protection. While we are being protected by this person, this person extends us some more facilities. This person shows us a better boundary wall to construct around our house. After the wall, he suggests us buying a good car to feel safe. Later he offers us a better home. We gradually move from “being independent” to “heavily dependant” on this rich person.\np: The banks just like this person are rich guys around us. We go to them to seek protection. We buy a car, it is somewhere financed by these banks. Basic salary is a protection extended by same rich guy. Our retirement house is also a favour extended by him.\nh3: Why would a rich guy finance our protection?\np: Banks need to stay rich. Lending and financing basic protection to the poor has to have a fee. Poor pays above and beyond his earnings to sustain a protected life. It creates an imbalance. Rich stays richer and always charges some fee to ensure poor stays poor.\nh3: Trade vs Interest vs Us\np: Generally speaking, we are encouraged to save more for our future. Most around us who saved more money today, managed to earn a good retirement house. Very few who invested in trade and got successful are so few we can not rely on these examples. Rich guy knows the value of our money we are giving to him today. He will invest it today in his personal initiative and gather more ways to fixate us into coming back to him.<b> The money we get from rich guy for a personal luxury goes back to rich guy as we buy this luxury</b>.\np: Rich guy is investing, taking initiatives and getting richer each passing day. While we are guaranteed of a better future. Our today is <b>broken</b> for a better future. Rich guy’s today is <b>secure</b>, future is also secure.\nquote: Allah destroys interest and gives increase for charities. And Allah does not like every sinning disbeliever. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 276\nh3: Conclusion\np: It is strictly forbidden to invest in interest based systems. There is no justification to support any argument against Quran. It is equally encouraged to invest in personal initiatives. Investing more in trade will earn us more in income. Investing more in riba / interest will make it difficult for us to liberate ourselves from the wrath of riches.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Feminism in Islam\np: Some questions that bothers us, made our women go out on strike fighting for their rights.\np.b-left: Why is it not allowed for women to play in open grounds side by side to men?\np.b-left: Why our daughters can not go out in open just like men do?\np.b-left: Why men are given more rights then women?\np.b-left: Why is this life so difficult for women; what is their fault?\np.b-left: Why can’t our daughters participate freely in athletics / olympics / sports?\np: Something has impacted our lives. We were not always living our lives this way. It happened very recently that women felt insecure and went out fighting to win security. Men became bolder and angry to beat women to their knees, as and when they found a women raising her voice. Happening in areas of low literacy, in Asia, 3rd world countries, backward areas.\np: USA, Europe, modern world still allows women to live there freely. A man raising his voice, hand on a women is made to undergo investigation. Not happening around here. Man raising his voice in this part of the world is Islamic-ally accepted and allowed.\np: People who follow West flourish. People who do not, decline. Does West follow Islam? Yes to some extent they follow, but Islam does not allow our girls to wear short dresses and play football in public.. This confusion leads our daughters astray from our religion. They go all out, fighting for their rights and some times they become Qandeel Baloch and at other times just a snubbed voice in the corner of a home.\np: Girls are given equal rights in Islam:-\nquote: And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 228\np: Girls are given rights but they are not equal in responsibility. Something to understand here, the lynchpin, if they are equal in rights then why do Men have a degree over them?\np: Men are physically stronger, responsible to take burden of our homes, stable in decision making. The in built functionality of men can not be challenged. Women are equal to them in rights. But the functionality of women is different. They are impulsive and emotional.\np: <b>Now, is this the case with all women? </b>\np: No. All women are not emotional and impulsive. Just like all men are not responsible. All cars are not reliable. Some break the first day they come on the road. Cars that are designed and built in-houses are weaker compared to the ones built by Toyota. Men that come on the road of responsibility out of pampered houses break the first day.\np: Inherently, genetically, a man feels better if he leads. A women feels better if she is loved. They are opposite sides of the magnet attracting each other.\np: Allah (swt) is all wise and all knower. He plans things His way. My justification can be wrong but the incident below is not wrong.\nh3: Khawlah bint al-Azwar\np: Khawlah bint al-Azwar was a Muslim warrior during the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and later a military leader. She has been described as one of the greatest female military leaders in history and was once compared with Khalid Bin Walid by the opponents in the battlefield. She was the sister of Dhiraar bin Al-Azwar, the soldier and commander of the Rashidun army during the 7th century Muslim conquest. Born sometime in the seventh century, daughter of Malik or Taken bin Awake, one of the chiefs of the Banu Assad tribe, Khawlah was well known for her leadership in battles of the Muslim conquests in parts of what are today Syria, Jordan, and Palestine. She fought side by side with her brother Zarrar (ra) in many battles, including the decisive Battle of Yarmouk in 636 against the Byzantine empire. On the 4th day of the battle she led a group of women against the Byzantine army and defeated its chief commander and later was wounded during her fight with a Greek soldier.\np.note: <a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawlah_bint_al-Azwar”>Click to go to her wikipedia page</a>\np: Girls can fight the battles, lead them riding horses wearing armour. They can play football with all their energies, get injured, fall and rise. They can go do athletics. It is just fine for them to roam in public <b>covered</b>. They have same books to teach themselves from that exist for others to learn from. They can excel in every corner of this life that they want to.\nh3: Let’s stay put..\np: Staying put to Islam does not limit us, it protects us from cringing complexities of society we live in.\np: Islam is a wonderful religion. It frees every bit of us. No dowry, no jewlery, no prison cells. You divorce you don’t want to live together. You do not want to go to Jirga / elderly in your tribe to get divorce approved, do not go.\np: You just get a divorce if it does not work. It is not as worse as “telling a lie” in public. Lies have become sober, normal and practical solution to our lives.\np: And divorce? It has become the <b>”least liked ruling to Allah (swt)”</b>?\np: What Allah (swt) hates we are holding tight to it. And what Allah (swt) allows, we use it to break our daughters.\nquote: And if he has divorced her [for the third time], then she is not lawful to him afterward until [after] she marries a husband other than him. And if the latter husband divorces her [or dies], there is no blame upon the woman and her former husband for returning to each other if they think that they can keep [within] the limits of Allah . These are the limits of Allah, which He makes clear to a people who know. <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 230\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Why are we divided?\np.note: We have completed Surah Baqarah today. in’sha’Allah with this pace we will complete Quran by December 2020.\np: Seriously, is there really a need to call myself a Sunni Muslim. Shia, dyobandi or Wahabi. We have disintegrated ourselves into sects and created a divide within us, ourselves. If Europe can unite with all its religions and secularism why can’t we unite.\np: Shia, Sunni, Wahabi, Dyobandi are all names of groups with deviated intentions. A muslim, true muslim who lives his life by the book does not really care to which sect he belongs. He just calls himself a muslim. He lives by the principles written in one book “Quran”. He does not confuses its messages. He does his research himself, resorts to conclusions he draws himself.\np: Sect word is blatant wrong. It only creates divide. We muslims starting from Indonesia to Mauritania, all are exactly 1 thing, “Muslim”. The division among us has consumed all our energies.\nh3: How do we get rid of this divide?\np: We are suffering each day. Each day is harder than the previous one. Islamic states are in a state of emergency. We need to get out of this problem sooner. How exactly can we contribute in liberating our states out of poverty?\np: We have to focus on ourselves. We have to start with “I”.\np.b-left: 1. I have to avoid listening to people who put themselves in certain boxes of religion.\np.b-left: 2. I have to read Quran more often. Quran is claimed to be an open book. Its followers do not go astray.\np.b-left: 3. I have to act upon what I read. If I get afraid I will go astray, I have to re-assure myself, it is an open book.\np: I have to act muslim. I face an indian muslim. I embrace him. Because he believes in my Allah and my Prophet (PBUH). If I hate him because he is from India. I am still sitting in a box. There is a dire need I get out of it.\np: I have to live my life in its entirety. I can not limit myself under any circumstances; “a teacher will come to open my brain and fix me.” No teacher will come, I have to fix myself. I can not rely on any body else but my own conscience.\np: We all are miracles in ourselves. I am not better than you. You are not better than anybody else. We all are super perfect people with very logically working brain. We use this brain, we get out of trouble today. We do not use this brain, we wait for a teacher to come and fix us,  we are only delaying our exit from the box.\nh3: Should I argue with people who are in this box?\np: Do not argue. Act. Be quite. More we argue, more we lose our ground. More we act honest, more we gain the ground. Box people need teachers, imams, ancestors to move on a track. Free people need Quran to move towards the direction.\np.note: This seems controversial but the ayat which is coming ahead, is truly a marvel.\nh3: What is the risk involved if I live in a box?\np: The Quran tells crisp and clear to live our life out of box.\nquote: It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book; <span class=lavendar>in it are verses [that are] precise</span> - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. <span class=lavendar>As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], </span>they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them].<span class=lavendar> And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah </span>. But those firm in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.\" And no one will be reminded except those of understanding. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 7\np: Quran is precise. It is really understandable for those who are firm in knowledge. People who are not so firm, focuses on unspecific, seeking discord and seek an interpretation that is suitable to them.\np: Basic meaning of Quran is to submit to Allah (swt). It negates fitna all together. Shiaism, Sunnism, Wahabism and all sects with its sub sects are fitna if they divide muslims. People of Allah (swt) do not really need a logic to love Him. They love anybody who love Allah (swt). If on one side there is Allah (swt) on the day of judgment and on other side there is a shia brother; who we focus on? We will focus on Allah (swt). Some shia brother, wrong practices of Islam, indian muslim will not really matter while we will be facing our Allah (swt). We will only be accountable for our relationship with Quran.\np: Allah (swt) wants us to unite with Quran as foundation. Just holding tight to it will keep us on track. If we want leniency in some verses and we end up asking for an easier interpretation we are really going into fitna.\nh3: For example..\np: Hazrat Sulman Farsi (ra) was raised as a Zoroastrian, then attracted to Christianity, and then converted to Islam after meeting Muhammad in the city of Yathrib, which later became Medina. He was looking for people who were on truth before declaration of Muhammad (saw) as prophet. The basic meaning of truth was clear to him; people who act honest. His struggle to find truth lead him to Prophet (PBUH). The moment he found truth he focused on it and embraced it.\np: After embracing Islam he was appointed as the governor of Al-Mada'in in Iraq. According to popular tradition, Muhammad considered Salman as part of his household (Ahl al-Bayt). He was a renowned follower of Ali ibn Abi Talib after the death of Muhammad. He is credited with the suggestion of digging a trench around Medina when it was attacked by Mecca in the Battle of the Trench.\np.note: <a href=https://youtu.be/TpO89LMFcno target=_blank>Click here to listen to his story on Youtube</a>\nh3: Conclusion\np: Islam is a clearly defined religion. Anything that feels wrong, really is wrong. The moment we seek leniency in its orders, we go astray. We do not know what Quran means until we act on it.\np: Ibrahim (as)’s fire was well lit fire. People did real hard work making the biggest fire for Ibrahim (as). He was thrown into it. It was not until the catapult released him, the fire turned all green, cozy and comfy. He jumped with a blind faith into fire. Let Allah (swt) do the magic for us. Let us jump first and ask later. Let us love Him. Our fire will turn into comfort after we jump. Before jumping some molana or mufti won’t convert Allah’s fire for us to cozy, comfy and green garden. Our faith is all we are going to take with us on our death. Go blind when reading Quran. Act on it blindly. No questions asked, straight to the point, act on it for all big things only happen after we jump.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: How to respond to criticism?\np: Imagine, Allah (swt) talks to you directly. He sends Quran to one among you. He (swt) is in direct conversation with one among our people. He even leads us to a victory through Angels in Badr and leads us to better understanding of Him in Uhud. Like He is always there approachable, available and sending down His message. If we want to follow people who are on right track, we can not find people better then those who were in direct contact with Him (swt) through Prophet Muhammad (saw). That time dictates:-\np.b-left: Should we kill the blasphemous 1400 years ahead in future.\np.b-left: Should we place the insulter of our Prophet (PBUH) in solitary confinements.\np.b-left: Should we kick the guy who incites us by burning Quran.\np: So these people are in direct contact with heavens above. Not only muslims. Jews and christians a like. They get live instructions. Quran being a live book, does not fade over time.

You say your prayer. You pay zakat. Because this religion is a religion of peace. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junaid_Hafeez\"><i>It does not tell you to put these people in Solitary confinements. </i></a>And when you listen to Allah (swt), as in Ayat 112, you will not have any fear of them nor sadness will get to you. <b>In short, a tip to living a fearless and happy life is to stay calm, peaceful and let go of the dirt thrown at you.

Gardens are green, rivers are flowing, calmness dominates, happiness lasts eternally, with spouses loving us and above all the creator providing for us all visible in its entirety. If we doubt these gardens, we really are not enjoying our life. We are doubting our life, present and future. Allah is watching us and he is protecting only those among us who repent to sins and ask for His protection from the fire.\np: Right after repentance, we are immediately expected to:-\np.b-left: <b>1. Be patient.</b> Not impulsive and reactive but disciplined and maturely.\np.b-left: <b>2. Be truthful,</b> to our spouses, friends, colleagues and subordinates.\np.b-left: <b>3. Be obedient.</b> We do not resort to intoxicants to find comfort. We avoid music, lies and everything wrong to follow His commandment.\np.b-left: <b>4. Spend in His way.</b> Parents first, then relatives, orphans, needy and travellers; as mentioned in following verse:-\nquote: They ask you, [O Muhammad], what they should spend. Say, \"Whatever you spend of good is [to be] for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler. And whatever you do of good - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.\" <br> - Surah Baqarah verse 215\np.b-left: <b>5. Repent before dawn (Tahajjud).</b> Early in the morning when we believe our Creator is closest to us waiting for us to ask Him, that He blesses us sooner.\np: Purpose of these blogs is to repent more often and get more closer to Allah (swt).\nh3: Next purpose.. Write non stop with all my love.\nquote: Indeed, those who have believed and those who have emigrated and fought in the cause of Allah - those expect the mercy of Allah . And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 218\np: After repentance, seeking His forgiveness and obeying Him, I have to strive harder, farther and longer.\np: If I am worried He will not forgive me, I am wrong. He is forgiving and merciful, He will forgive me. He loves me today. Today He will bless me with comfort. I have to trust Him and write whole heartedly, lovely and consistently. Every night I have to overcome by desires and fight in the cause of Allah.\nh3: Do not act macho man.\nquote: They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, \"In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit.\" And they ask you what they should spend. Say, “<span class=lavendar>The excess [beyond needs]</span>.” Thus Allah makes clear to you the verses [of revelation] that you might give thought. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 219\np: If people say, I am having trouble enjoying my life. If they say I am not drinking wine and gambling more, I am not really enjoying my life. I can not give an ear to what they say. If someone says “<b>I can not really follow Prophet (PBUH), considering him being a Super Human. I can not really spend my hard earned money on his teachings</b>”. I just have to write the response here, “<b class=lavendar>Spend the excess</b>.”\np: I do not go all macho man justifying my comments and words. I just have to write what Quran says.\nh3: Reward is near..\nquote: Allah witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and [so do] the angels and those of knowledge - [that He is] maintaining [creation] in justice. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 18\np: Allah is maintainer of justice. Justice that is visible to His angels and His creation with knowledge and understanding. Justly sooner than ever we will be rewarded for our efforts.\nh3: Quickly embrace Quran\nquote: Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is swift in [taking] account. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 19\np: I can not be worried about what to write. What really will impact the reader. People who were given the scripture differed out of animosity. They really understood the Quran and the Prophet (PBUH), but they failed to embrace it.\nh3: Coming to the point..\nquote: So if they argue with you, say, \"I have submitted myself to Allah [in Islam], and [so have] those who follow me.\" And say to those who were given the Scripture and [to] the unlearned, \"Have you submitted yourselves?\" And if they submit [in Islam], they are rightly guided; but if they turn away - then upon you is only the [duty of] notification. And Allah is Seeing of [His] servants. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 20\np: The purpose of these blogs is mentioned in above verse. It is to read Quran, act on it, share it and avoid arguments. Purpose is to notify and deliver Quran on internet. May be there are excuses:-\np.b-left: Islamic websites are not really designed well.\np.b-left: No body relates Quran to our routine life.\np.b-left: Islam is easier but no one re-affirms its softness on internet.\np.b-left: There are some but they do not really talk much.\np: May be there are blogs that fill this gap and notify people. Youtube videos and books that emphasise on softness of Islam. Still our kids are finding it hard to go to mosques.\np: I am speaking bold, but I might be able to fix this part of Islam on Internet where it is portrayed all hard, threatening and dangerous. Patiently, truthfuly, obediently on the way of Allah (swt), I might succeed in creating the dent. I might fix these issues.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Living brighter\np: Imagine the most colourful place in the world right now. <a href=http://www.heatherwick.com/project/google-mountainview/ target=“_blank”>Google Headquarters</a> really fascinate me. <a href=https://www.dezeen.com/2018/09/05/mpk21-frank-gehry-facebook-silicon-valley-headquarters-menlo-park-california-architecture/ target=“_blank”>Facebook rooftop co-working spaces</a> are amazing too. Recently I went to <a href=https://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/the-tower/design-construction/ target=“_blank”>Burj Khalifa Dubai</a>, they have this amazing museum at its base. Think of any <a href=https://www.igeeksblog.com/top-ten-awe-inspiring-apple-stores-in-the-world/ target=“_blank”>apple store</a>. Look at this blog. Its design and choice of colours. <a href=https://www.archdaily.com/211943/starbucks-coffee-kengo-kuma-associates target=“_blank”>Starbucks cafes</a> and gloria jeans. Clean roads and colourful buildings. Nordic design with a sprinkle of asian touch. Amazing people on stage talking heart winning speeches.\nh3: Who is behind all these creations?\np: Allah (swt)? Jesus? No. I am not giving a sermon in a mosque. I am not talking hardships and boring religion. Awkward bearded people talking rudely, not today. Today I am talking brightness not boredom.\np: <b>So who is behind all these creations?</b>\np.b-left: <b>1.

Steve jobs launched the 1st iPhone.</b> Listen to his speech by <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4U5FqrOdQ target=“_blank”>clicking here.</a>\nquote: This is a day, that I have been looking forward to for two and a half years, and today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone. <br> - Steve Jobs on launch of iPhone\np.note: Today’s point is so important, I had to list all these people with links pointing to them. Click on their name to go to their wikipedia profiles.\np: Every good design around us has been designed with really an intense amount of passion. Love for innovation and creation brought these marvellous designs to us. Allah (swt) did not bring these things to us directly. It was people who carefully designed these products.\np: People who changed this world for better, were those who did not really care about losing their car or money to their passion. They invested all of themselves into their idea or goal.\nh3: Now, what stops us from living brighter?\np: Fear of losing reputation, wealth and stability. We have imprisoned our freedom ourselves. We never jump, never fall. Always resorting to somebody else bringing us the money and benefits. We are willing to work for somebody else who can bring us a better retirement home. That is it.\np: We never really live and one day we die. We never really create amazing architects, vlogs, products and speeches. We just die one day living in prison. Some spikes do come in our life where we want to break these cuffs, tapes tied to our mouths. But after a little spark we go back to ‘living safe’.\nh3: Why we underestimate ourselves?\np: Consistently resorting to fear, makes us feel low. Not good enough to inspire and create fire. Just resorting to fear for so long has convinced us we are ‘not good enough’. We become really good managers in our career, but when we want to invest on an idea, we resort to safety. We are really good developers, but when it comes to marketing our product, we are afraid of talking on camera. We have patches of energy, skills and inspiration to work on 1 part and miss out the other important part. We always underestimate ourselves before every decision. The most safer way is actually the worst way. The hardest route to battle is the best way.\nh3: How do we walk on hard path?\np: We need fire in ourselves. Passion is another word for fire. We need enormous passion to walk on harder paths. We need to define goals that define us. We need to find purpose of our lives. If you see Steve Jobs’s above speech, try to feel the passion in his voice. He moved blindly to his goal. More people did not fear him. They made him richer, more fire-ly and brave-ly to run faster and harder towards his goal.\np: There is no other way of enjoying our lives. Luxurious cars and bigger homes do not bring enjoyment. They only bring in more luggage to maintain. We end up living miserably. Fighting with our wife to fix a socket and forgetting “where did i place her tea pot?”\nh3: How do I create fire?\np: Now I am going to become that awkward rude bearded person, who talks Quran and gives credit to Allah (swt).\np: <b>But I did not mention any religious person up there?</b>\np: Honestly speaking, these people really walked on the path the Quran speaks about. They did not really care about investing their money into their goals. They did not really fear losing their money.\np.note: Wait a moment. Be with me..\np: Follow these steps:-\np.b-left: <b>1. Change your desires.</b> Refrain from smoking, running after wealth and hotter girls.\np.b-left: <b>2. Create discipline.</b> Make a clearer environment around you. Muslims have an advantage here. They can go to a mosque 5 times a day to meditate in a cleaner place.\np.b-left: <b>3. Look towards your goal everyday.</b> Practice daily on traits that move you towards your goal. Write daily, code daily, speak daily.\np.b-left: <b>4. Jump.</b> Spend your wealth, gold, silver, fine branded horses, cattle and tilled lands in achieving your goal.\np.b-left: <b>5. Iterate.</b> I have read this book on iterating more often and faster. “The Lean Startup” by “Eric Ries”. It tells to iterate sooner.\nh3: Interesting twist\np: <b>If I spend all my wealth, gold and silver in achieving my goal the first time, how do I invest it the second time?</b>\np: I have done it in 2016. I sold my MacBook Pro mid 2015 to the lowest bidder and paid my debt. It freed me of my dependance on my wealth. Today, I have a Macbook, iMac, Apple TV, iPhone 8, Fitbit watch and an ADF Epson Printer. I gave myself all out, but still I have everything. How is this possible?\np: The moment we give ourselves all out to our goals, we make it easier for ourselves to invest in future opportunities. We avail more opportunities and we become rich sooner. We lose some but the pace of losing and winning is so fast, it hardly matters.\np: Running away from wealth and stupid desires creates fire. What is Quran’s take on it?\nquote: Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire - of women and sons, heaped-up sums of gold and silver, fine branded horses, and cattle and tilled land. That is the enjoyment of worldly life, but Allah has with Him the best return. <br> - Surah All Imran verse 14\np: Allah has with Him the best return. Not in hereafter but here in this life. If this world is beautified after walking on Quran, why should not I walk on it?\np: Quran is not boring. It is a bright book that tells us to live a richer life. Invest in your goals with all your energy, you will find fire that makes living fun.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Miracles do happen\np: We wait for miracles all our life to happen. At times we long for kids in an older age, at times for exponential success and some times we run for finding comfort in our nominal pays. We want to see real big miracles happen in our life. But deep inside our hearts there is a fear of them not happening. The bond between what we want and what we believe do not really exist.\np: People who win lotteries, who win Oscars, who get lucky are also from among us. Same eys, ears, brains, lives, nominal pays as we have. They get lucky through some coincidence and they win? No. Miracles happen, we get lucky, we win lotteries ourselves. Coincidence happens because miracles happen.\np.note: If it seems confusing, wait..\np: I am pointing to a fact, Quran establishes in its stories. It narrates entirely miraculous events to re-affirm us, <b>same God who was behind those miracles is still there. He has not changed neither retired</b>.\np: We are stuck at this thought, “<b>It is always how much hard work we put in, we get back out</b>”. Yes, hard work pays us back, but real magic happens when God intervenes into our routine lives and fixes some dents.\nh3: But how does Allah (swt) intervene?\nquote: So her (Mariam) Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zakria. Every time Zakria entered upon her in the prayer chamber, <span class=lavender>he found with her provision</span>. He said, \"O Mary, from where is this [coming] to you?\" She said, \"It is from Allah . Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account.\" <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 37\np: Marium (as) finding her provision in her shelter directly from Allah (swt) is harder to believe. Speaking it seems illogical. How is it possible, Allah (swt) intervenes in the systems of this world and provides her food literally through an angel.\nh3: Why do Allah (swt) talks of miracles in Quran?\np: We pick a book. We read opinions page in a news paper. We start reading any good magazine. What is really the motivation behind those stories? The author of any article only wants his readers to get valuable information out of it. Some authors want we increase our knowledge, some want us to live a better life, some want to focus better. Authors, designers, developers only succeed when their products are valuable.\np: It would be really stupid for a writer to write down his thoughts with out any purpose. It would be really awkward for a traveller to move head-less, purpose-less. It is equally awkward, Quran mentions a story and it is not implementable in its reader’s life, in our life.\np: The story of Mariam mentioned in above verse is solely meant for me. It is solely meant for the verse’s reader. It is only speaking out loud “<b>Miracles do happen</b>”. He (swt) provided her with food physically intervening into this world’s defined boundaries. He gave her Isa (as) with an equal miracle. There was no husband, yet she gave birth to Isa (as).\np: Miracle did not stop at Mariam giving birth to Isa. It created ripples around her. People linked with Mariam (as) are touched. They pray to Allah (swt), they are also rewarded with miracles.\nquote: At that, Zakria called upon his Lord, saying, \"My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer of supplication.\" <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 38\np: Zakria (as) was a true believer. He was a true believer even before witnessing the miracle happening with Marium (as). He became stronger in his faith, prayed vigorously for a son.\nquote: So the angels called him while he was standing in prayer in the chamber, \"Indeed, Allah gives you good tidings of John, confirming a word from Allah and [who will be] honourable, abstaining [from women], and a prophet from among the righteous.\" <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 39\nh3: How can we expect a miracle?\np: According to Quran, Allah (swt) will physically protect us from harm. He will physically give us victory in Badr. He will literally put a better mobile in our hand, a better car underneath us and a better scenery right in front of us. He will physically and literally free us of our burdens through miracles.\np: Do not work hard. Honestly, this is what <a href=https://books.google.com.pk/books/about/The_80_20_Principle.html?id=3F0zDAAAQBAJ&source=kp_cover&redir_esc=y target=_blank>The 80/20 Principle </a> book says. Do not work hard. Work easier and smarter. Live happier. Opt the easier path to success. Find Allah. Fall in love with Him. Let Him take care of us. Let Him do miracles for us in our life. Give time to families, enjoy your mornings, walk with a smile on your face and visit His planet. Take photos, shoot videos, compile them, start vlogging. If you can not do this, work on something else that brightens your day.\np: Mariam (as) and Zakria (as) did not have Quran to re-assure them, <b>”miracles are real”</b>. They were not so lucky as we are. We have Quran narrating their story and speaking to us “<b>Miracles will happen, relax enjoy your life, miracles are around the corner, just love your Creator and ask Him for miracles</b>.”\np: Stick to the promise we made to Allah (swt) in Surah Fatiha;\nimg.width-half.no-border: fatiha promise.png\np: and He will take us to our destinations in a BMW, watching Netflex, our kids / wife beside us, faster and happier.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Fixing us\np.note: I am going to speak like a speaker to an audience in an open auditorium. Consider yourself sitting in the audience looking at me speaking. Please take home the conclusion that fixes all our problems because I have read something really life changing today..\np: Ever been in a situation where you find <span class=lavendar>more sugar</span> in your cup and you get angry. Your <span class=lavendar>plug </span>won’t fit into the socket and it irritates you. Your computer hangs up and it won’t fire up. A small piece of code takes entire day to fix. Some equipment does not work the way it is supposed to, makes us irritated.\nh3: Why do we get irritated?\np: We want to fix something really logical. No body can argue about these irritating things being wrong, you want to fix it, you fail, you get irritated. Getting irritated is a totally normal reaction to such illogical and blatant wrongs.\np: Let me amplify it a little. It goes equally well while we are arguing with a highly illogical person. You do not fix the argument or the illogical person, that person might harm himself. He might harm others. Getting really irritated here is again totally normal. It happens to all of us. Our kids don’t listen to us, we get irritated. They do mistake, they hurt themselves. We don’t want them to fall the way we fell.\nh3: So.. should we not get irritated?\np: No. We should get irritated. It is a normal reaction to every abnormal event. We should react while in irritation. We have to <span class=lavendar>pour in more milk in our tea to disappear excessive sugar’s</span>. We need to <span class=lavendar>fix the points of plug / socket </span>to get it across. If we stop and don’t react to the abnormal, it is only going to delay us from reaching our goal.\nh3: Be careful\np: The only thing we need to fix in our lives that can fix the excessive sugar in our tea, a broken socket and a kid getting spoiled, is we have to be <b>‘careful’</b> while reacting. First word coming out of our mouth against an argument has an impact. Raising of our finger to raising eye brows, each reaction in our body has an affect. We need to be really careful while responding to these very logical irritations.\np: We are a miraculous creature who speak not only with tongue but with eyes, fingers, body movement and all our energies. The tone of voice only constitutes 38 % of our verbal communication.\nimg.width-m-75: 7 percent.png\np.caption.text-center: <a href=https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=2043156 target=_blank>Click here to go to above research.</a>\np: Therefore it is clear that <b>”We should be really careful while responding to abnormalities”.</b>\nh3: Where am I going?\np: <b>Case 1</b>\np: Dr Abdul Salam died a Qadyani muslim. He won a noble prize in 1979 for Pakistan. He was made to leave Pakistan but he kept his linkage all along. His work is still appreciated around the globe. He died in 1996. We removed the word muslim from his grave after he was buried in Chiniot, Punjab, Pakistan.\nimg.width-m-half: abdus salam grave.png\np.caption.text-center: Marble stone installed at grave of Dr Abdus Salam\np: <b>Case 2:-</b>\np: Malala Yousafzai, the 2nd Pakistani awarded a noble prize in 2014 <b>”for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education”.</b>.\np: She has been labelled a complete propaganda to further defame Pakistan. It is considered she is ruining image of Pakistan by exploiting its sensitive issues. The more she talks about these issues, the further the image of Pakistan deteriorates.\nh3: Is our reaction justified according to Quran?\np.b-left: The socket in the wall if hurts our feeling, what our response should be? May be we need to calm ourselves down a little and try again by making minor fixes in the faulty adopter.\np.b-left: If our kid doesn’t listen to us, may be we need to calm ourselves down a little and carefully help him fix himself. The moment we kick our kid out of home, or we label him a blaspheme or a propagandist, we hurt our own home.\np: Similarly;\np.b-left: The moment we label Dr Abdul Salam a non muslim, we remove the word ‘muslim’ from his grave we hurt our own home ‘Pakistan’.\np.b-left: The moment we declare Malala a ‘propagandist’ we hurt our own home ‘Pakistan’.\np.b-left: The moment we declare Indian muslims our enemies because they did not accept the two nation theory of Quaid-e-Azam, we hurt our own home ‘Islam’.\np: <b>The moment we declare people on wrong track, the wrong doers all out loud in streets, beating buses, burning tires, we do only 1 thing. We hurt our own home ‘Islam’</b>.\np: In today’s lesson, Quran emphasises on coming to common terms to establish peace;\nquote: Say, \"O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah .\" But if they turn away, then say, \"Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].\" <br>- Surah Al Imran verse 64\np: We have to represent Islam as a wonderful religion. It speaks of unity. It attracted masses and dissolved super powers like sun vaporising liquid. It fixed the middle east, Rome, Persia, sub continent up-til Spain. It fixed us back then. It has the power and energy to fix us again.\np: I believe if we take baby steps and ‘Fix Us’. <b>This all technology that is making these blogs happen, have all the power and might to unite all of muslims again</b>. Walking down this road of ‘<b>staying careful</b>’ we might unite. We might liberate ourselves of our sufferings in Uyghur, Kashmir and Palestine.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Peeled Skin of a Banana.\np.note: I saw this happening today in our local vegetable’s shop..\np: A poor person peels the banana, throws its skin on the floor, kicks it under the table inside a vegetables shop and walks away. Who is responsible for the throwing of garbage on floor, kicking it under the table and walking away? He is already poverty struck. Asking him to refrain from doing it, won’t stop him in future.  He lived his entire life in difficulties, finding ways to feed his children and surviving the chaos created by the riches. What can be done that changes the way people behave sanely and do not litter around?\np: Where can we white collar people, driving luxurious cars, using credit cards, buying J. clothes intervene that has an impact? What exactly can we do to make a difference?\nh3: Do we listen?\np: Before answering questions and finding answers, go 1 step further back. I am wrong or right does not matter anymore around us. I am better than everybody else around me. My thoughts are more refined. I need to take advise from others, but still I myself have an opinion that is finest and can not be altered. Such thoughts make us go blind slowly and gradually. The more we start focusing on ourselves the more nearer we go to becoming deaf to sane voices.\np: For a moment can we open our ears and listen to Quran. Can we stop considering it a supernatural thing, not so possible to act upon, thing. There are verses in it that are spoken by the Creator of us and this planet. He is worried about us.\np: These three verses in the Quran have the potential to shape our entire society. That person throwing skin on the floor to we not listening, are all events totally interconnected. These strings can be connected by acting upon the following 3 verses. It will shape us into a fixed society where we will build lives of people. We white collar people will fix it.\nquote: O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him]. And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and <span class=lavender>do not become divided</span>. And remember the favor of Allah upon you - <span class=lavender>when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers</span>. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided. And <span class=lavender>let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong</span>, and those will be the successful. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 102 - 104\np: Allah (swt) is speaking to us. He is right above us looking at us. He shakes the planet, brings earthquakes, rains thunders on us, that we listen to Him. He really does not want we break His expectations of <b>”becoming His representative on this planet”</b>. He knows each of ours potential. He does not overburden us more than we can carry. Right above, looking and wanting for us to talk to Him. He never talks about conflicts and divides. He does not want us to disrespect our neighbours. He tells us to not litter around. He wants us to paint our lives with colorful vibes. He wants us to eat from His fruits and roam around on His planet. He wants us to stay away from division that we excel in our lives. He is here, if He wills, it will all become sober, nicer and peaceful. He does not want us to forcefully submitting to Him, He wants to find out people who really are showing the willingness to listen to Him. Only some of these willing workers of Allah (swt) will fix the broken fabrics of our society.\np: We learned people need to take responsibility to fix the damage done to Pakistan, India, Iran, Afghanistan and all muslim states. We learned people who can read good english and understand Quran. Key factors from quoted verse above are below:-\np.b-left: 1. We need to <b>hold tight to the rope of Allah (swt) </b>even in times of low faith. We need to embrace Quran in totality. It is not dangerous to act upon its verses.\np.b-left: 2. If we are believing in Quran, <b>we can not become divided</b>. We need to resolve our personal conflicts with our brother, boss and colleagues. Anger is not a solution, if it creates divide. If love and harmony creates unity, we need to embrace our faulty boss, faulty colleague and faulty wife in its totality. Love brings better harmony, results in beautifying our bonds. This ultimately results in a better society.\np.b-left: 3. <b>We were enemies, we were at the brink of falling down fighting with eachother into fire, He saved us before</b>. Christians, Jews, Muslims all are brothers if we start following Quran. Do not change your label, keep it ‘Christian’ but read Quran, start finding the creator around us and we will become brothers. We brought up in Islamic homes are also not so religious people, believing in the truth of Quran. We were just given the book to preserve it in our upper shelves. If you start finding Creator by reading Quran, it really does not matter from which faith you belong, you start becoming closer to Muslim’s creator. You will be standing closer to Allah (swt) on judgment day if you started acting on it, if you refrained from littering in the streets, kept neighbours happier, emboldened a just society, spoke truth and acted responsibly. You ‘Christian’ will take more marks than me, whose Quran is held high in his room’s shelf.\np.b-left: 4. Invite to good, enjoining what is right and forbid what is wrong.\np: We white collar, educated people are responsible for fixing the broken fabrics of our society. A guy who is already struck with poverty and lawlessness can not really throw the peeled skin into a dustbin. <b>We broke him hard, he is tired</b>. We need to fix the poverty and lawlessness that peeled skins from bananas really start falling into their right places.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: How long does it take to live?\np.note: This topic came to my mind a moment ago standing in kitchen making coffee for wife. Ok, with coffee..\np: Guys, last year on 27th February 2019, it was a bold moment for all of us. We downed an Indian aircraft. A day prior, we were really annoyed for letting Indian jets fly back out with out targeting it. It was an attack on our sovereignty. 26th February 2019, we were angry. 27th February 2019, the next day we were proud. Today is 2 February, we are sleeping fine and forgetful, how close we went to a nuclear war. It has been 11 months since last year’s major escalation.\np: These past 11 months, there had been numerous fights, a number of losses and so many failures. We even lost people very dear to us. After all these downs, we are still sitting here in our cozy beds, not much affected.\np: Simply, we lived a year of troubles without even feeling a breeze of it passing. The brink of nuclear war failed to wake us up. Today Coronavirus is spreading like a fire storm, but we are sure we can not die through this plague. Deep in heart, we know it is in China not in my city.\nh3: Life expectancy?\np: A good healthy Pakistani lives around 70 to 80 years if he does not die due to a heart attack from extra spicy desi dishes. A good athlete lives 100 years, still with all chances taken and no natural calamity occurring. Most die of earth quakes and car accidents.\np: 9 Million people die each year due to cardiac arrests. 1.3 Million people die each year due to road accidents. <a href= target=_blanl>Link here.</a> 99.999 % die each year over the age of 100 years old. I am 32 right now. If I am lucky I will die in 60 years.\np: Earth came into being about 50 Million years back. So many generations have lived since earth’s creation, affected by worst storms. Just like the famous movie, 2012, Nooh (as)’s people have seen the entire planet flooding with water. They sit in a ship and survive. Some generations were freed of Pharoah and some were saved from a complete Nuclear war on 27 February 2020.\nh3: Why are we sitting dumb folded?\np: May be we need to put a reminder beside our bed or write in bold big letters somewhere prominent in our homes about this time leaving us behind. Else this year is also going to pass and we will still be sitting on cross roads looking at sky wondering when the next buzz will wake us up.\np: We are moving quite fast each day. Last year it was escalation, we were standing on the brink of a nuclear war. Then we talked of North Korea fighting US. Now we are shouting it is Iran vs Arab vs US. Time is simply passing by us. It is really ruthless, doesn’t care if we are careful in handling it or not. It is hitting us with failures, losses and hurdles that we wake up, but we are resorting to being more safer and less riskier. We are not kicking our adrenaline, we are not becoming adventurous and we are not worried about another year spent in loss.\np: Guys, the best way is the Quran way. It became all adventurous and still it is focusing on us to liberate ourselves of our own fears. Willingly or un-willingly we are going to meet our Creator in some moments, it is upto us how we prepare ourselves.\nquote: So is it other than the religion of Allah they desire, while to Him have submitted [all] those within the heavens and earth, willingly or by compulsion, and to Him they will be returned? <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 83\np.b-left: Do we stick to same old rotten legacies laid out by our ancestors or we go out find the new bright truth?\np.b-left: Do we even plan to take some falls this year?\np.b-left: Do we want to portray ourselves an example for our kids?\np.b-left: Do we really care about the time rushing through us?\np.b-left: How are we going to stand and when? What is going to come to make us live a bolder and a better life?\np: I am talking all macho right now, I know I lived an entirety in darkness. This past month is a roller coaster of red bold high events all under the shadow of Quran. Each day is zillion times more productive than yesterday.\np: I really want we all taste the colors of our mosques. It is library today, laboratory tomorrow and a place to play with our kids the rest of the year. We all have mosques in our towns, that can serve as an amazing co-working space, with a projector screen and sermons being delivered using laptops, nicely built powerpoint presentations. People are discussing ideas in already built calm mosques serving as the center of our light solving our basic social issues.\np: Mosques have the potential to repair the damaged part of our society. We need more engineers, doctors and scientists to lit them up, paint them with good colors, install large video walls and nice spot lights that attracts our kids.\nh3: Conclusion\np: It really takes a moment to change our entire life. 1 single moment made me a programmer where I decided to purchase a 11 Dollar Web Development Course on Udemy in 2016. 1 single moment made me smoker-less where I decided I will not move away from my mother for 3 days. 1 single moment made me rich where I decided I will no more bound my self by illogical limits. It only takes a moment. The blink of an eye is all it takes to live.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Listen please.\nimg.width-m-half: calm city.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@nikolayv?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText target=_blank>Nikolay Vorobyev</a> on Unsplash\np: This city above has few high rise buildings across the ocean with low traffic rush. People are jogging in the evening. Some are going to meet their families. A lot of them are earning good. It speaks of comfort, luxury, peace and calmness. The effort of some good governances made it possible for these people to live in harmony and enjoy their lives. Good life expectancy, lower poverty, better education and above all; cleanliness.\np: Good governance is directly linked with easier life. I am from Pakistan, so I take this country as my case study today. We are a progressing state. These past few years we have seen certain downs in this country. Economy is lowering, education system can not ignite passion in ourselves, poverty is increasing, each passing day it is becoming difficult to obtain calmness and peacefulness. Overall we all agree this country was nose diving into chaos.\nh3: What happened after the nose dive?\np: We got the best prime minister who have all traits which are needed to build this country back. Passionate, positive, not giving up, enlightened and believes in Pakistan transforming into Madina (a just state). Still he is talking heart winning speeches around the globe. Today he met one of the greatest leader, Mahatir Muhammad, and expressed himself maturely. Adequately delivered his message to all muslim states who were opposing the earlier summit held in Malaysia.\nimg.width-m-half: imran statement in malaysia.png\np.caption.text-center: Link to article by Dawn is<a href=https://www.dawn.com/news/1532420/pm-regrets-missing-kl-summit-over-others-misconception-it-would-divide-ummah target=_blank> here</a>\nh3: What does Quran say about ruling the realm?\nquote: And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 105\np: According to Quran, Imran Khan is working on the right path. His today’s statement emphasised upon unity of muslims, as are his previous efforts and statements.\nh3: Why should I care, I can’t find cheaper food.\np: Most among us are getting tired of future hopes and gradually we are getting buried in huge economic fall. Price of cars is going up, most commodities are getting harder to get our hands on and life is really not getting any easier. It is true, it is really not possible to live in peace with all these troubles.\np: May be our Prime Minister needs to resolve internal issues before he gives lengthy talks on international problems. May be internal affairs take priority. May be if he places better people in his cabinet he is able to fix these issues sooner.\np: All good things and correct decisions taken by Imran Khan will lead us to a better place. All good things and correct decisions taken by me do not really have an impact at national level. May be I should not really worry how we can get out of economic crises, because it is not my job. It is true, we really do not have to worry about economic crises in somebody’s elses realm. Realm of Imran Khan has to be fixed by himself.\np: My personal opinion is, if Imran Khan keeps on talking about unity at international level, stays passionate and do not really give up, he will be able to address the poverty issue inside Pakistan also. It will take time.\nimg.width-m-half: Ghabrana nai hai.jpeg\nh3: Coming back to the topic\np: I am king of my realm. My realm is my kitchen, my bathroom, my bedroom, entry lounge, lawn outside, the flowers in the pots, green garden, my part of the front road, neighbour, close relatives, colleagues, bosses, friends and people we interact everyday. I am king of all these areas. I need to talk of unity when there is a conflict that can be fixed with my intervention inside my realm. I sometimes do not have to talk, sometimes I have to act that brings all these pawns of my realm closer to each other. I do not need to say it out loud, ‘Pray your 5 prayers a day’. I need to just act that makes it colorful for the people of my realm to grasp it.\np: I need to build the better building with mirrors glowing on top, people jogging in the evening, meeting their closed ones, where people feel financially comfortable and they really enjoy their lives. I need to fix the realm sooner, because people in my realm are suffering of conflicts and failures.\np: If I start fixing my realm, people in my realm will create more kings. It will create a fusion factory where kings are made. As soon as we become a society of kings, we will see nearly no body who is poverty struck. We need to start from our branch of Imran Khan’s realm. Bottom up, slowly and gradually curing my realm, Pakistan, in’sha’Allah.\np: May Allah (swt) help us fix ourselves that we inspire our surroundings with our actions. Amen\np.note: Guys, if you like this project. Please follow this project's page on twitter. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zakatlists\">Click here to go to the twitter page</a>.

        "body": "h1: Do we have resources to fight our enemies?\np.note: Fight is not required at all. Please watch following video by Lesley Hazleton. She has written two amazing books on Islam; ‘Epic Story of Shia-Sunni Split’ and ‘The First Muslim’.\niframe.width-m-75.d-flex.m-auto: https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Y2Or0LlO6g\np: Articles and books written by Muslim writers do not tell the story of Islam in its entirety. We either go entirely biased towards our famous figures or we consider them too super human to follow them completely. Work of some Non muslims about our Prophet (PBUH) and his companions, gives nearly accurate picture of early Islamic days.\np: Lesley Hazleton, few of those writers, has written these books, which many consider too volatile to be discussed in Islamic states. These books and similar animations or movies made on prominent companions deliver better understanding of our religion. After all we are more inspired by worldly successes. It is also wiser to find the Creator starting from the world around us. Directly embracing spiritualism makes it harder to find the Creator around us.\np: Above video focuses on a key aspect where Muslims <b>exploit the statement of killing the disbelievers</b>. As you watch this video you become clearer that Islam operates on different levels. The foundational level of convincing our enemies is polite and attractive. We need to embrace the fact that killing and shedding blood is the last thing happening on a Muslim’s list. If it can be avoided, it has to be avoided.\nh3: Case studies\nh5: Case 1 - 1965 War\np: I am not a very knowledgeable person. That is why I will be resorting to basic examples. I watched a video of Zaid Hamid explaining the 1965 war as a miraculous war. Our artillery guns were able to fire beyond their possible range right on their targets. There was something bigger involved. While we were wrapping suicide jackets around us to blow enemies tanks, the fighter jets of the likes of MM Alam were destroying enemies jets. 1 jet per minute was going down and our enemies were baffled. There was a bigger force in play during 1965 war that made us victorious.\nimg.width-m-half: 1965 Australian Frontpage.jpg\nh5: Case 2 - 27 Feb 2019 Abhinenden\np: I heard the details of this fight at some forum and did not really believe it until I read following verses from Quran. I heard from some educated people who have really excelled in their careers that the day Indian jets were pursuing our jets over Kashmir and Northern Pakistan, <b>it was mostly our luck</b>.\np: Our jets released the flares in air which took the shape of a fighter jet. It confused Indian pilots and they went on pursuing it, trying hard to take the flare cloud down. They went distracted.\np: Some superior force literally intervened that made simple flares look real jets in the sky. We found a way to hit back and quite easily took Abhinenden’s jet down. <b>We took them down in air physically, on ground psychologically and across the world; proudly. It was one proud day for all Pakistani’s around the world.</b>\nh5: Case 3 - Shaheed Captain Ali Maggsis\np: We have heard so many stories, some of them doubtful. Mentioning super natural powers intervening and magic happening in our scientific world. Watching below video makes us question our sanity.\np: The way Captain Ali Maggsis experienced magic in his life, hardly happens. We either consider it doubtful or we consider it super human. By negating these real experiences we actually negate the following verses of Quran.\np.note: ‘Following’ verses are further below.. wait..\niframe.width-m-75.d-flex.m-auto: https://www.youtube.com/embed/NoPdDaQNvMw\nh3: ‘Resourses’\np: Muslims fought in Badr, Uhud, Trench, Tabooq, leading all the way to Yarmook. It was not wanted prior to all wars but circumstances enforced these battles on us. As we failed at finding the easier solution to a conflict, we ended up fighting our enemies who were always more in numbers and significantly advanced in technology and weaponry. Their horses were always better tamed, soldiers better fed, tents better pitched. Their armies were always better equipped than Muslims.\np: It gives an impression that we were better in our Faith and always fought more vigorously than our enemies. But today’s lesson in Quran told me I have not been entirely correct all my life. It was not our Faith that powered our engines of heart to bring us to victory. It was something beyond our Faith and our capabilities.\np: It is true, we always fought with a roaring heart and bold faces. Our battle cries always did put fear into our enemies hearts. <b>The way we make point on media, threatens the entire world of an unavoidable Nuclear War</b>. Wether Iran or Pakistan, our voice always rippled deep into our enemies hearts. It is true, we have the bravery unmatched but what is mentioned in Quran asks us to stop taking credit and give it to the one ‘Allah’ who really makes it happen.\nh3: Quranic intervention\np: Quran focuses on helping us from the outer world. It was battle of Badr where Quran tells us, the Creator literally brought the angels on this planet, all visible and scientific. Nothing spiritual or supernatural, real people, long beards running beside us.\nquote: [Remember] when you said to the believers, \"Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you with 3000 angels sent down? Yes, if you remain patient and conscious of Allah and the enemy come upon you [attacking] in rage, your Lord will reinforce you with 5000 angels having marks [of distinction] <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 124 - 125\np.b-left: Some Muslims did not see the angels directly, but saw the effects of the angels such as one Muslim named Hazuim who reported seeing the head of a fleeing pagan get mysteriously cut off before he could reach him. Hazuim had been giving chase and he heard a swashing of a horse whip and then a detached voice say, forward Hazuim! <br> <br>When he reported the incident to Muhammad (saw), he said to Hazuim, You have said the truth. This was help from the third heaven.\np.b-left: <a href=https://www.islamicity.org/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=24084&title=the-miracle-of-angels-in-the-battle-of-badr target=_blank>Link to the topic is here</a>\nh3: Conclusion\np: The answer to the question ‘Do we have resources to fight our enemies?’ is really there in Quran. We might be lower in number and gadgetry but we have the Creator with us. He will send angels down for us to fight for us. The quickest way to standing victorious in our battles is not accumulating huge ordnances and making superior bombs. This way is the slower way. The quickest way is to fix our connection with the Creator. The moment this link is established, we will have better bombs and better ordnance along with real angels standing beside us.\np: May Allah (swt) give us victory over our enemies. Amen.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project. Please follow this project's page on twitter. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zakatlists\">Click here to go to the twitter page</a>.

        "body": "h1: Road to success\np: We all want some things in our life that are difficult to achieve. We want higher rank, a good home, excelling children and a respectable status in our community. All these things require tremendous amount of work.\np: We wake up early in mornings, prepare ourselves for the day, go office, perform tasks to their best. As the time to return home nears, we pack up and move back to our homes. Our family receive us. They always have some news to share. We are served good tea in a cosy place that we tone down our day’s stress.\np: All of these cycles are repeated everyday. Waking up to sleeping back into the bed is focused on achieving a place of comfort in our community. We want better future for our children. We work hard, feed them that they stand up to our expectations.\np: A perfect life is lived all our lives. We near our retirement to hold on to our children’s shoulders. They put in their best to keep us protected of elderly sickness. They help us walk back again. Sometimes they succeed, other times they fail. The body stops working as it is supposed to work. Eyes do not see properly, hearing lowers, old age hardships encompasses us.\np: The death wears us down. We die, every one mourns the loss and they start preparing for their deaths.\nh3: The next step on the stair\np: We were moving up the ladder of our life. Death meets us and it takes us further in our pursuit. We earned a lot of goodness during our life and we are lowered into our grave. Angels await us, our Creator meets us and gives us glad tidings. We sleep in our grave and wait for the day of resurrection. We are kept in the comfort of our Creator. It is a good part of life again.\u000bp: We witness the physical reality of an unending world. It calms us down of the worry of falling into another pit. The days where children were failing and it was stressing me, are now over. This time in grave is only meant for us to feel safe in the beds made by our Creator.\np: This time keeps on moving forward till we enter the next phase.\nh3: Rising up on the day of resurrection\np: The judgement day nears. A horn is blown. We wake back up. We are taken to the ground of justice. We are worried. We might fail here and never enter the paradise. Something keeps assuring us of our children’s good deeds. How we managed to feed them halal and make them the leaders of the future. Our children excelled in their lives, brought good name to muslims. Islam prospered due to their contributions. Our communities rose higher for their inputs.\np: These relaxing reflections of our past comfort us. We see creator, He is happy with us, we feel better. Our Prophet (PBUH) is here with us and his companions are standing beside him. It is a better world out here. The plane of Arafat feels like a garden from the heaven. The success is kissing us. People who dominated the world of justice are standing in front and around us.\np: We are given the reward of our deeds, it is all clear.\nh3: Entering the paradise\np: The bridge named ‘Sirat’, narrower then a hair awaits us. As we near it, it also broadens up. The crossing is a little easier. Their the heaven awaits us. Khalid (ra), Abu Bakr (ra), Umar (ra), Ali (ra) and their likes are welcoming us. We meet the companions with a pride on our face. Our shoulders broadened, worries dusted, pride filled hearts meet the true warriors of Islam.\nh3: We succeed in our life\np: The moment of shocks and turbulence is over. We succeed in finding the Paradise. It is where there are rivers flowing under dense green trees. God is above us looking for us. Angels are awaiting orders. Everything which lacked ‘abundance’ back on earth, is now in ‘abundance’.\np: This moment will make us forget the failures of earth; the property disputes to our divorces. Life will get back on track and we will be ruled with love of God above us.\nh3: Conclusion\np: We take small happenings around us too heavy. Our children wrong us and we get angry. Wives are always angry and sometimes we retaliate which leads us to ‘repenting’. All important things are not older than 30 years; the time passed in a moment.\np: These tiresome nights sitting on computer won’t worry us on our death. We might meet Allah of of our hearts with all our love.\nquote: Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your [full] compensation on the Day of Resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained [his desire]. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion. <br>- Surah Al Imran verse 185\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

It is a dreadful view. People around are standing in shock. Boxer is the bad guy who made use of his strength.\nh3: Who is this boxer?\np: There are some questions which might make us familiar with the boxer.\np.b-left: <b>Does this boxer always punches weaker guys?</b> <br>No he does not always punches people around. He also sits at home with his family, eats meal and talks normal.\np.b-left: <b>Does he always react angrily?</b> <br>No he is not always angry to people talking to him.\np.b-left: <b>What all other activities he has to do in his life?</b> <br>He goes out, takes bus daily, pays his bus fare, does grocery, laundry and all things normal people do.\np: Just like every bad person who gives us good reasons to get rid of him. Every drug addict, murderer, lier and thief. They all have one thing in common, <b>they all act human some part of their every day.</b> I am not going to say, they were bullied their entire lives or this society pushing them to their limits. Their wrong acts can not be justified. But their good actions can not be ignored.\nh3: Who is the nice guy?\np: Somebody who acts all religious, talks truth, stays clean, gives good sermons, write good articles?\np: No, this guy is not always truth, honesty, cleanliness and good sermons. This guy also tells a lie, goes extra angry in his affairs, at times is aggressive in his speech, is bragging about his actions and goes all out correcting people, hurting them, making them go away from ‘nice’ world.\nh3: Common factors in bad and nice guys\np.b-left: They both do bad things. They both hurt people. They both sin.\np.b-left: They both do good things. They both want to correct their lives.\nh3: Who is the real bad guy?\np: The person punching the weaker or the extremist watching porn or a feminist bullying men or the soldier beating the Kashmiri. Who is the real bad guy?\np: They real bad guy is <b>desire, lust, addiction, anger.</b> Islam names this bad guy ‘Satan’. Atheists name it ‘bad actions’. Humanitarians name it ‘in-humane’.\np: We have given this bad guy a name, we know who is behind all these punches, lies, stealings and aggressiveness. The real bad guy is always hiding behind the skin, flowing through our blood, convincing us to label the extremist ‘an extremist’, the fornicator a ‘sinner’, the killer ‘an evil’,  instead of a human.\nh3: Understanding bad guys\np: Each bad guy is a human under his skin. People left out in asylum houses due to depression and oppression are always human. Kids rotting in solitary confinements are again human. The guy who is angry and the firown (cruel leader), who is killing are again human. These people are not the culprit. They can be blamed for listening to their desires but they can not be labelled ‘evil’. They are a kid under their skin who need protection from the evil dominating them.\np: If we want to correct the killer, do not label him killer and evil, label him ‘mistaken’. He did a mistake, but he does not do mistakes all day long. He also needs the comfort of bed just like all preachers and sobers. He also needs a blanket to lighten him up a little. He needs a sober guy to understand him and fix him.\np: Even if we fail to protect him from his own wrath, do not attack him. Do not bully him. Let him live. Let the sinner live that he finds his way to comfort.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Do not hate the boxer. Hate the ‘Satan’ who made him fall. Give it a real image; long face, evil horns, black face, two long teeth. Consider it standing behind the boxer, feeding him with anger to make him punch people around.\np: Do not feel bad if you are a boxer. No body is humane around us. ‘Satan’ is always beatable. Repent now to your Creator, tomorrow if you sin, no problem, repent day after tomorrow. <b>Keep the cycle of repentance alive till it really brings you out of misery. </b>\np: Launch, Fail, Iterate.\nquote: And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except Allah ? - and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know. Those - their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow [in Paradise], wherein they will abide eternally; and excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers. <br> Surah Al Imran verse 135 - 136\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Finding God\np: I did not know there exists a God. I prayed during my childhood believing my parents might be right. Later in my teenage, I said my prayers because I wanted to clear my exams. I was praying out of doubts, thinking I might go to hell. The concept of hell was so fearful it made me stick to the mosques. I really never knew there existed a God. The moment I went to mosques, it was some guy reciting Quran all out loud. The first 2 rakkahs of prayers were always sober, longer and easier to match the pace. The last 2 rakkahs always gained speed. Matching the speed of our imams was also confusing.\np: Now I have entered my adulthood. I am 32 years old. I believe God exists. He is out there somewhere. But where is He? When will this quest to find Him finally complete?\np: These are some questions that shake me every now and then. Everyday going to mosque for Quran class, I ask myself where is God and when will I be meeting Him?\np.b-left: <b>Do I get answers to these questions? </b> <br> No. I do not know. I really want to know about my Creator but how do I find Him.\np.b-left: <b>Does it make me a disbeliever? Does it make me ineligible to enter paradise? </b> <br>May be, I go to hell. But again is there really a hell.\nh3: Who claims this world?\np: I do not know the owner of this world. It might be evolution of life. Matter transforming into bigger particles converting into elements that make a monkey and finally makes me. There might not be any world after this life. This life and nothing after this life. I really do not know what has happened before my birth. Most things I listen in history are lies and then again most of them are fabricated truth.\np: Stephen hawking rejected the existence of God in his final book.\nquote: \"If you like, you can say the laws are the work of God, but that is more a definition of God than a proof of his existence,\" <br> - Hawking wrote.\np: It all originated from a little speck that generated trillions tons of energy to create a bang named big bang. Nature is there but nature only describes God, it does not prove there is a God. We need proof, right in front of us where God is talking and re-affirming us of His existence. Even if He is there, why does not He end our sufferings. Why God is so selfish?\nh3: Did I waste my time in mosques all my childhood?\np: I believe, yes, I did waste my time in mosques. I used to recite Quran to some bearded guy who sat beside me while I dodged the verses to finish the lesson sooner. Sooner I could get rid of this teacher and I could get back to my normal life.\np: I did not find anyone telling me of God’s existence around us. I only was told to <b>”not ask questions”</b>. Asking questions will take me out of my religion and a bigger fire, a bigger hell is waiting for me. These are difficult questions and God does not answers everything. I was told:-\nquote: “He wants our ultimate submission and nothing else. He is powerful, mighty and huge, challenging His authority can harm me.”\np: In short; I was told it is dangerous to find Allah. I should sit back and listen to what this bearded guy says. I do not really have the freedom to find Allah by myself.\nh3: Is it alright to ask questions?\np: I just did say all my heart out. These are the questions that bothered me recently. Most of these are still in my heart.\nh3: Who do I go to ask these questions?\np: There is no tolerance among us to listen to these questions. Who should I go and ask without getting labelled blasphemous or ignorant. I do not find a way to reach to answers in our mosques. Our libraries do not have religious scholars. Good scholars are also not approachable.\nh3: Why I am reading Quran?\np: This book has eased my life a little. My relationship with me wife has improved. I am feeling calmness in my routine affairs. Speech is also improving every day. In short I feel I have the energy it is needed to find Allah. If this book is so claimed to be true, I might find Allah. If this book is not real, I will not find Allah. I will go to some other book and start looking again.\nh3: According to Quran when will I find Him?\np.note: I will try to explain using the example of a house.\np: The house has windows and doors. The windows of the house have to be opened to let sun light enter the house. The interior will only stay healthy if the doors open, exhaust fans work, routine maintenance is done.\np: If I am the house and I want to get the sun light, I will need to open the windows for light to enter. Without opening these windows and routine maintenance I will not get the light.\np: The window is refraining from lying all day, beating the kids, hurting neighbours, take drugs. Refraining from anything that distorts image of reality will only take me away from light. Window will not open and I will not find God.\np: According to all the religions in the world, there is goodness connected to God. Pick hinduism, they believe we need to be good to people around. Gandhi was a Hindu who said\nquote: Happiness is when what you think, what you speak and what you do are in harmony.\np: I am only opening the windows of my house because Gandhi influenced millions. He was a great leader always speaking of equality and humanity. Just like Gandhi, all great leaders and righteous people focused on becoming better human beings.\nh3: When will I find Allah?\np: I might not find Him in this world. It is possible. But I will not die repenting I did not try. I will try to be a truthful person and read Quran daily. If there is a God, I will find Him. If there is none, I will not.\np: Following verses are said to be revealed during the battle of Uhud. Muslims were vehemently opposed from fighting the battle out of city of Madina. 1000 Muslims moved to the fields of Hejazi where 300 returned, not so convinced to fight 3000 Meccans. The remaining 700 bore severe losses. As these 700 fighters returned homes, they were mocked by the people who returned to Madina. “We asked you to stop, do not fight the majority, you fought and you lost”.\nquote: O you who have believed, do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brothers when they traveled through the land or went out to fight, \"If they had been with us, they would not have died or have been killed,\" so Allah makes that [misconception] a regret within their hearts. And it is Allah who gives life and causes death, and Allah is Seeing of what you do. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 156\nh3: According to Quran\np: I will find Allah only when I will get out of my home to find Him. I will bear hardships, stresses and failures. I will stick to the goodness preached by Gandhi and Quran. I will stick to it and believe in God preached by all world religions. One day He will come right in front of me. That day might make me stop running and eat the fruits of my hardships.\nquote: Then after distress, He sent down upon you security [in the form of] drowsiness, overcoming a faction of you, while another faction worried about themselves, thinking of Allah other than the truth - the thought of ignorance, saying, \"Is there anything for us [to have done] in this matter?\" Say, \"Indeed, the matter belongs completely to Allah .\" They conceal within themselves what they will not reveal to you. They say, \"If there was anything we could have done in the matter, some of us would not have been killed right here.\" Say, \"Even if you had been inside your houses, those decreed to be killed would have come out to their death beds.\" [It was] so that <span class=lavendar>Allah might test what is in your breasts and purify what is in your hearts</span>. And Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 154\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: What is it to believe?\np: A human mind needs connections, justifications and logical evaluation of happenings to conclude. All conclusions drawn inside brain relate to the information it has. At times the information becomes dull and boring which makes the mind go asleep. Other times it is bright and easy to grasp, our mind wakes up. The information, its chaining and evidences are important factors to reach to a solid conclusion.\np: We fight over God. Whose God is it that is right. Which religion is it that really matters. Labelling Islam as the only perfect religion without feeding the right information, connections and meanings to our brains do not make us believers. To become a believer is not an easier task. It takes a toll on human body. Huge amount of information needs to be evaluated, sorted, filtered and connected to finally reach the point where one can claim himself a ‘believer’.\nh3: Paradise is for believers\np: It is true. Only believers will enter the paradise. Only people who are closer to the right God and His prophets are worthy to taste the flowing streams, green gardens, blossoming flowers and eternal life. The people who finally managed to find the right God will be rewarded.\nh3: Which God is the right God\np: All religions are fighting over the God. We all have taken the responsibility to defend our forefathers’ religions. We believe it is really easier to ‘Believe’. We also find it comforting to not think about believing because it takes huge effort.\np: Labelling myself a believer only because my community forced it on me, doesn’t really make me a believer. I am just another pawn in the game of chess where other pawns are attacking me. I surrendered to the label of society. I am still not a believer who can convince myself; <b>‘Why am I a believer?’.</b>\np: If we do not really believe, how can we convince the world to believe in our God. Lack of understandings, confusions and doubts do not go along with believing. <b>We can not defend our God until we ourselves believe in our God. </b> Without believing we can not conclude <b>‘Our God is the right God’.</b>\nh3: Feeling the belief\np: The belief in the existence of God is a complicated step. It makes you atheist first, then it makes you a muslim. The label given by your family binds you to one religion. Later it makes you question your own sanity that leads you to stop believing. You are bound to a label not the belief. The moment you challenge this label your life can go back to ruins. It has become hard to become a logical believer.\np: Feeling the belief is the supreme task assigned to us. It is about feeling the Creator’s presence around us. We might call ourselves Christian, Jew or a Muslim but the fact remains there, the belief of having God around us surpasses all material logics. It is about believing in his all 4 x books. Bible if acted upon renders its reader eligible for heaven.\np: I can not decide about other’s dealings with the creator. Torah if read properly, acted upon will lead the Jew to heavens. I can not really decide how the Creator interacts with people from other religions.\nh3: Conclusion\np: A Tsunami is approaching us. It is going to drown us away. On Judgement day, we will not be looking at a Jew standing beside us. <b>We will be looking at the Tsunami of injustices, mistakenly committed by us back on the planet earth. </b>\np: The God binds us to connect with Him only. Anybody who is connected with Him is His friend. He is the sole creator of heaven and earth who needs attention. He needs our time.\np: Our affairs with other religions matter only because there is a God. If all other religions submit to God, we can not really blame them. We are bound to embrace them.\np: The real problem is not <b>“we are followers of Quran that we start feeling extra ordinarily right”.</b> The real problem is <b class=lavendar>we do not believe in Quran and its Writer. </span>\nquote: O you who have believed, persevere and endure and remain stationed and fear Allah that you may be successful.<br>- Surah Al Imran verse 200\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: How I managed to arrange a successful meetup?\np.note: I arranged a meetup by the name of ‘techshek’ on 9th February 2020 at Twinhub, Islamabad, Pakistan. You can join this community by clicking <a href=https://www.meetup.com/techshek/ target=_blank>here</a>. You should also join <a href=https://getmakerlog.com/ target=_blank>getmakerlog</a> to find hundreds of passionate people. Join <a href=https://www.ramadanmakers.com/ target=_blank>RamadanMakers</a> to get continuous support.\nimg: techshek2.jpg\np.caption.text-center: This is me starting the event\np: I am not a very great speaker. Neither can I speak good English. I am just an average guy who did not earn a dime his entire life over internet until recently. I made two websites, both for my close relatives and they both paid me around 90000 PKR (600 USD). Presently, I am running <b><a href=zakatlists.com target=_blank>zakatlists.com</a></b> where I write this blog and I share my university course under zakatlists.com/school. I tried to sell the <b><a href=zakatlists.com/school target=_blank>‘zakatlists.com/school’</a></b> website to my uni for 1000 USD but they did not reply back.\nh3: Idea\np: I was in Islamabad for my university exams on December 2019. I looked for open meetups in Islamabad. I couldn’t find any. It was relative colder and people might were reluctant to host meetups.\np: I felt there is really not any culture of connecting to people around here in Pakistan. Although I saw online, people found a lot of potential walking this road. I said, I should work on hosting my own meetup. A place where we can talk ideas. I was overly excited.\nh3: Creating an online community\np: The next step towards making the meetup happen; was to create an online community on Meetup.com. All upcoming events listed on google are pulled from this platform. I created my own group with the name of<b> TechShek</b> which did not work out. Meetup considered it a marketing platform and deleted it.\np: I notified the attendees on twitter about the incident. My entire day I was feeling like a failure. It smashed me hard. I had a dinner with a colleague’s family, where I couldn’t discuss politics like we normally do. It was a boring day where I did not find any positivity.\nh3: After the first punch\np: The day I was discouraged by meetup.com was a bad one. But the next day, I got a message from meetup.com where I can step up to the Organizer’s role of another group of 420 people. I immediately stepped up. Kept my 2300 Ruppees (9 USD / Month) subscription valid. I sent an email to all the members and circulated the plan to conduct first meetup.\np: Excited again, feeling succesful again. People responded back, joined the event and it was done.\nh3: Chapter 1:- Meet and Greet\np: Finally, the day of first meetup came, link <a href=https://www.meetup.com/techshek/events/267878904/ target=_blank>here</a>. We were expecting around 40 people in total. We arranged the chairs in the hall room accordingly.\np: But, there were only 10 people in total. All family members and close friends. I talked in a lower tone feeling ashamed of myself in front of my wife. But my Co Host Wasif pushed me to speak better. So we concluded the event with good plans for the rest of the year.\np: The entire drive of 4 hours to my home was very hectic. The event did not go well. It was literally paying Rs 7000 (50 USD) for a family gathering. In Pakistan it is a lot of money.\nh3: Chapter 2:- Speak your heart out\np: My family members, cousins and friends started asking me to conduct this 2nd meetup on 9th February. It was planned initially as the first event but the earlier event of Meet and Greet, pushed it down to Chapter 2.\np: It was a wonderful crowd. People were talking out loud. Energy, rythem, fire oozing out of the hall.\np: <b><a href=ramadanmakers.com target=_blank>RamadanMakers</a>, an online community of developers, co sponsored the event.</b> The owner of community has a paid subscription of whereby.com that all live stream the event.\niframe.width-m-75.d-flex.m-auto: https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJHYX1OYKs0\np.caption.text-center: Video made by <a href=https://twitter.com/fajarsiddiqFS targe=_blank>Fajar Siddiq</a>\nh3: Was this event a success?\np: I did not earn any money out of it. It was all paid by myself. I am still not earning any thing out of any of my projects. I am still standing at zero.\np: To answer the question, <b>Was this event successful?</b>, I would say, <b>Yes</b>. This event was a huge success. I talked to people, people got inspired, they talked to people, some more people got the fire. It was one amazing day in my life where I managed to achieve something, I dreamt my whole life; <b>fearlessly talk on stage</b>.\np: I am still getting <a href=https://twitter.com/zakatlists/status/1226742961645457410 target=_blank>retweets</a>. Brothers and sisters who attended the event are also working on their personal projects. We all are thinking on the lines of doing bigger things in our life. We might not earn a lot, but we plan to keep going and do not stop.\nh3: The recipe\np.note: I promised to talk Quran in these blogs. But today I am not talking Quran.. ?\np: I believe it all happened due to only 1 reason. I have obliged myself to <b>”reading Quran daily and acting upon it</b>, till it is completed. It has done something magical in myself. It feels like things are easier to do and they are not really far. At times it feels there is another energy that is pushing it all forward.\np: Every morning is brighter than the previous one. Each passing day, my relationships are healing. I am moving towards unity. Respect is flowing into my life, smooth. There is something with this Book that lifts and makes a dull life magical.\np: Even if you are a non follower of Quran, I strongly suggest read a portion of it and act upon it for next 30 days. It will make your dreams come true.\nquote: He has sent down upon you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel. <br> - Surah Al Imran verse 3\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Might of Allah\np: Today Quran talks precisely about the distribution of inheritance to our close ones. If Child dies, mother gets 1/6th of her share. If mother is a widower, she gets 1/8th of her share. After each decision, Quran speaks of the might of the Creator. For example\np.b-left: <b>1. Verse 4</b>. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.\np.b-left: <b>2. Verse 9</b>. So let them fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice.\np.b-left: <b>3. Verse 10</b>. And they will be burned in a Blaze.\np.b-left: <b>4. Verse 11</b>. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.\np.b-left: <b>5. Verse 12</b>. Allah is Knowing and Forbearing.\np: The rhythm of these sentences is found in entire Quran. There are decisions, instructions, obligations and immediately after these rulings, there is the might of Allah.\nh3: Believing in Quran\np: First miracle in anybody’s life is, may be, birth. You come out of your <b>mother’s belly</b>. You grow as you eat<b> food</b>. After spending the rest of the life in this world, you<b> die</b>.\np: During each miracle, science strives to explain it. The belly gives the child, we start labelling it a natural act. Science labels it sequence of miraculous events.\np: We label food, natural ingredients, to run human body. We grow, labelling it natural. We die and label death a result of Natural Causes.\np: The earth is an extra ordinary piece of nature. Each passing second, the earth is surrounded with another miracle. We witness this miracle and <b>we run to prove it is natural or scientific</b>.\np: We strive hard to make ourselves believe it is just another act of nature.\nh3: Nature = ?\np: Nature is not artificial. It is anything breathing. The earth, is breathing. Animals grazing on it are also breathing. We believe the nature of earth is causing this planet to rotate. There is gravity linked with the earth, that keeps the animals from falling off it. Anything that can not be reconstructed is nature.\np: We label nature as a result of coincidence of matter and molecule.\nh3: Did anyone find the answer?\np: Every cellular structure inside nature is a combination of electrons, protons and neutrons. These are minute particles that make every molecule. Some grow to become a sperm and few grow to become earth. From minute to biggest structure is a combination of cells.\np: Next questions that need to be asked\np.b-left: 1. Why some electrons grow to look like sperm?\np.b-left: 2. How sperm decides it goes to womb?\np.b-left: 3. How does a baby stays alive inside a closed chamber?\np.b-left: 4. How does a sperm grows to a human being?\np.b-left: 5. What keeps the human from falling off the planet Earth?\np.b-left: 6. How many more Earth’s exist in a universe of coincidences?\np.b-left: 7. How big is universe?\nh3: Did we find the answer to our questions?\np: No. Our no question about nature goes answered. Each question takes us further down a series of rabbit holes and these questions never stop.\np: We did not find out the reality behind a sperm. Why it enters the womb? What makes a birth? Each question is only an argument.\np: The answers we find are literal scientific stories. Science never surrenders, it is a name of rabbit hole.\nh3: Conclusion\np: We do not ask 1 question.\np.b-left: <b>What if we die and there is a God?</b>\np: We do not submit to the vacuum created by our unanswered questions. Execution on Quranic instructions is only possible after we find Allah.\np: Once found; submit, surrender and move near Him. He is going to meet us the day we die in few days or months. A Might is expecting us. <b>It can happen that the day of our death becomes the ‘Happiest day’ of our lives. </b>\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Shocking misconception of punishments in Islam\nquote: Those who commit<span class=lavendar> unlawful sexual intercourse </span>of your women - bring against them <span class=lavendar>four [witnesses] </span>from among you. And if they testify, <span class=lavendar>confine the guilty women to houses</span> until death takes them<span class=lavendar>or Allah ordains for them [another] way</span>. And the two who commit it among you, dishonor them both. But <span class=lavendar>if they repent and correct themselves, leave them alone</span>. Indeed, Allah is ever Accepting of repentance and Merciful. <br> - Surah Al Nisa verse 15 - 16\np: Quran tells of punishing the people committing unlawful sexual intercourse in a very precise manner. Each punishment is thoroughly elaborated and self sufficient. It also focuses on the leniency it offers to its offenders. Quran maintains the sanity of this world and does not enforce any <B>‘difficult to implement’</b> order.\np: Above verse has following parts for punishing a fornicator:-\np.b-left: <b>1. Bring upon 4 witnesses. </b> If accuser is unable to bring upon these 4 witnesses, the punishment mentioned next, is inapplicable. Accused is free.\np.b-left: <b>2. Confine the guilty women. </b>It states of confinement to a closed house. She still can live inside this house, teach our kids, eat, live and does not undergo social victimisation.\np.b-left: <b>3. Allah ordains for them another way. </b>After the house arrest, it is also possible they do not die in there. They might are freed from the prison and they go out, if Allah wills.\np: I believe, it is not possible to keep someone under house arrest for the entire length of his / her life. Circumstances and scenarios that bound us, usually always create a soft corner for the victim. Prolonged confinements to houses is only possible after it gets difficult for the Judiciary to work independently. As there gets more people involved, like for example in democracy, the law becomes a complicated mesh of papers and rules. As soon as the judge pours in ‘human’ part of himself, the offenders start becoming productive to society. They get leniency to learn skills in their confined places which leads them to becoming a contributing factor towards society.\np.note: These practices are happening in <b>Norway at Helden prison</b>. Offenders are kept in a confined school where they are taught useful skills of wiring, mechanics, programming and if they can’t read or write, they are taught to read and write. <a href=https://showsnob.com/2019/04/13/inside-the-worlds-toughest-prisons-season-3-finale/ target=_blank>Link to post is here.</a>\np.b-left: <b>4. If they repent and correct themselves, leave them alone. </b>This part is mostly missed out in all punishments in Fundamentalist Islam. If the offender in prison comes to repentance, free him.\nh3: What confuses in Quran\nquote: And yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing. <br> - Jew Writer Lesley Hazlton <a href=https://www.ted.com/talks/lesley_hazleton_the_doubt_essential_to_faith target=_blank>talking about Quran.</a>\np: As we starting adding meanings and explanations, we start getting closer to becoming a <b>fundamentalist</b>. The punishments’ color fades out. Kind and soft meanings laid out in Quran starts diminishing. As these are executed out in purity, the collapsing society starts getting back on its own feet.\np: Quran does not talk of murdering the infidel, it talks of counselling, embracing and inspiring the infidel. It talks of healing the broken fabrics around us.\nh3: Conclusion\np: The punishments of ‘amputating’ the hand of a thief looks only severe because we do not know what it feels to sit in prison for an entire year.\np.b-left: 1 year in prison is greater than 1 less hand.\np.b-left: 25 years in solitary confinements is greater than 1 x death. <br>The death does not impact any body for 25 long years. <br>The pain of losing someone ultimately is healed. <br>However, the pain of feeding your child in prison for 25 years is heavier.\np: Above all, if there is a way to avoid death, amputation or confinement of criminal, do it. Do not cut a thief’s hand, if he repents. Do not confine a fornicator, if he repents. Do not enforce the highlightened version of Quran. <b>Enforce the Quran in totality, that it does not loses its colors and dulls down our religion.</b>\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Maintaining sanity\np: Quran is a diverse book. It is difficult to put its verses in boxes. Verses are interlinked with each other, their revelation circumstances, present happenings and reader’s intent. Each aspect varies the meaning. It is not possible to describe the meaning of a verse in its totality from a single perspective.\np: Understanding Quran is not just reading it, but acting upon it. Lack of action, makes us go wary off its meaning that leads us to stop believing in it. <b class=lavendar>It speaks of a colorful life where people can marry the captured prisoners, even if they are married. </b>\np: It looks abnormal and cruel. It is totally abnormal to take somebody else’s wife into marriage for personal needs.\nquote: And [also prohibited to you are all] married women except those your right hands possess. [This is] the decree of Allah upon you. And lawful to you are [all others] beyond these, [provided] that you seek them [in marriage] with [gifts from] your property, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse. So for whatever you enjoy [of marriage] from them, give them their due compensation as an obligation. And there is no blame upon you for what you mutually agree to beyond the obligation. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise. <br> - Surah Al Nisa verse 24\np: May be it is abnormal. But to understand the abnormality of these orders we need to find what is normal.\nh3: What is normal\np: Right now, I am sitting on the prayer rug beside a heater. My fingers tapping on this keyboard. Screen is black. Laptop is connected to the power supply. I am looking at the screen and thinking;\np.b-left: Heater is warm. Warm is a feeling. Warm is made up of a mesh of electric connections that is creating fire. Some neurons in my body are feeling the heat. How?\np.b-left: Fingers are tapping on the keyboard. Sequence of keyboard keys are registered in my mind. Fingers are pressing down, precisely and completely. The pressing of the button to understanding millions of combinations that create useful sentences. How can I encompass this information at one moment of time. Each moment, trillionth part of a second, the possible combinations the keyboard can be triggered, changes. How does I do it?\np.b-left: The screen is black. Black is a color. When a dog sees black, it finds no difference from any-other color. Dogs and cats are color blind. No animal on this planet can see all colors as humans do. The only creature triggering keyboard to make useful meanings come out of laptop, is the only creature that can see colors. Trillion of combinations in each second are linked to humans. How do I name the black, the real black?\np.b-left: Laptop and its connection to electricity is giving its battery the charge which is needed to keep it alive. Batteries convert chemical energy into electrical energy. The word<b> energy</b> is undefined and has been justified an infinite number of times. It can not be created or destroyed, it stays there.\nh3: So what is normal around us?\np: Nothing is normal. Each passing moment, we experience a magic and we reaffirm ourselves, it is normal. There is nothing normal in this world. It is all abnormal. The movement of earth, to sun throwing light at us, to being the only planet in the world, created from the minutest particles of neurones, protons and electrons, is all but not normal.\nh3: What if..\np.b-left: We are Adam.\np.b-left: We are kept inside a closed room for the first 30 years of life and we do not see the world around.\np: We will not believe the normal world. The sun, flow of river, the bird, clouds with water, blood in veins, insects making lines, fishes making patterns. We will not believe any of these magics if we come to Earth from another planet or space.\np: We have become habitual of living a life in a magical world. The moment the dimensions of our life changes, we get afraid of losing the part with which we are habitually connected. We are forgetting there is only 1 x Guy who is claiming the creation of all these wonders.\np: We are <b>afraid-muslims</b> or <b>afraid-believers</b>, because we have become habitual to the magic of the world. Its dimensions needs to be altered every day. <b>Each day, we need to jump atleast once to find Him</b>.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Becoming a believer is only possible after we find the abnormal part of our life. We can not truly trust the God, until we keep ourselves on our feet and we keep our eyes open. The lesser we think, the more we go away from Him.\np: If all the things happening around us all abnormal, there is no point of highlighting one more abnormal in Quran and labelling it weird. We may marry the captured girls from war, because it is said by Quran. The only book of 4 holy books that claims the connection to the creator of all the magics in this world.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Hitting a woman in Islam is allowed.. but\nquote: Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So <span class=lavendar>righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard</span>. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - <span class=lavendar>[first] advise them</span>; [then if they persist], <span class=lavendar>forsake them in bed</span>; and [finally], <span class=lavendar>strike them</span>. But if they obey you [once more], <span class=lavendar>seek no means against them</span>. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand. <br> - Surah Al Nosa verse 34\np: This is the highlighted version of Quran. Where I have selectively picked up one verse to justify <b>hitting the women</b>. It is allowed but Quran takes to this part of the verse gradually.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 1.</b> Connect strongly to the <span class=lavendar>bonds of relationships</span>.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 3.</b> Give<span class=lavendar> justice to women </span>who are slaves or orphans.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 4. </b><span class=lavendar>Protect their property</span> in orphanage until they grow old.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 11. </b><span class=lavendar>Give her </span>1/6th to 1/8th of your wealth after you die.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 15. </b>If she commits adultery, bring 4 x witnesses, confine her and wait until she repents. After that, <span class=lavendar>free her</span>.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 17. </b><span class=lavendar>Do not make life difficult</span> for her.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 20. </b>If you gave her anything in marriage, <span class=lavendar>do not get it back</span> in divorce.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 24. </b>Marry the war prisoners, to <span class=lavendar>make them equal contributors </span>towards a healthy society.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 28. </b><span class=lavendar>Marriage is made easier </span>for us to keep the women protected.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 34. </b><span class=note>as mentioned in above verse</span>, to keep the marriage intact, advise women, forsake them in bed and strike them. If they obey, <span class=lavendar>seek no harm against them</span>.\nh3: Linking the verses\np: The interlinking of these verses are emphasising on a united family system. The concept of relationship between man and woman is both romantic and purpose-built. It is also the most emotional feeling. Movies made on family life; <b>The blind side</b>, <b>The pursuit of happiness</b> and <b>The money ball</b> exploit the relationship within a family to bring in the emotional part. It is the fundamental fabric of a society. <b>Absence of a perfectly balanced family system gives spark to an imbalanced life</b>.\np: The moment a broken woman is brought into custody through marriage, the responsibility of providing them shelter is 100 %. But if they end up violating the laid boundaries, the punishment on them is reduced to 50 %. We get angry with them 50 % lesser, get annoyed from them 50 % less and we love them 50 % more.\nh3: Marriage is better than routine affair\np: Routine affairs between men and women do not bind us to helping each other. We still can untie, take a break and get away living in with somebody else. The focus towards building a better community needs us to marry earlier, sooner and blunt. 13 years old can marry 13 years old girls. Children can live a life of normalcy even after they are married earlier.\np: <b>Marriage can be taken as just another subject in their school. </b>The subject that teaches bold realities of life and brings responsibility and focus to its best students.\nh3: Hitting the women\np: “Hitting wives” is not needed. It comes after we start building a better society. It is only there in a <b>fundamentalists life</b> who picks a part of Quran to justify his anger. Anger is wrong. Hitting is right after anger is controlled. And after the anger is handled properly, healing broken relations becomes easier. Husbands become sober and they attract wives towards them. They start acting mature and truly embrace the status of a leader. They act leader-ly to inspire their families.\np: Family is a fun loving fabric of our society. It needs to be healed.<b> Directly reaching the ‘hitting’ part is only anger justified</b>. It is not Islam and it is not human.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Winners never Quit and Quitters never win\nimg: 46.jpg\np.caption.text-center: This is me and my brother in June 2017, before I got admitted (Aug 2017) to the psychiatry ward\np: I was thrashed brutally by my close family members yesterday over writing these blogs everyday and organizing monthly tech meetups. I was asked if I am taking my psychiatry medications or not. Weather I am living a sane life or not. I was also told, “<b>It is wrong to bring our daughters and sisters to tech meetups where I have also invited my close friends</b>”. Some of these relatives are rich and have accumulated good wealth doing business abroad. I was also asked if the books I am reading are complete enough to dictate the true picture of Quran.\np: I will try to write my answer to these queries, because I am a Telecom Engineer, who can make websites and write blogs everyday. I will try to act proud and blunt because I really do not care what people think of a person who writes everyday about <span class=lavendar>“Quran”</span>.\nquote: (O Muhammad) Say, \"I only advise you of one [thing] -  <span class=lavendar>that you stand for Allah, [seeking truth] </span>in pairs and individually, and then give thought.\" <span class=lavendar>There is not in your companion any madness</span>. He is only a warner to you before a severe punishment. <br> - Surah Saba verse 46\nh3: How did I become a psychiatry patient?\np: I started taking pictures everyday in <b>2017</b>, <span class=note>like the one above</span>. It went on for 60 days which lead me believing I can give Friday Sermon in our local mosque. I showed the intent at my profession to express myself.\np: Because it is unorthodox to give sermons for an engineer, I was made admitted in a psychiatry ward for 1 month. It is a prison cell where you can not move out. I was labelled a “<b>Mood Disorder</b>” patient.\np: Back then I did not have a protection wall around me, which made it relatively easier for people to get me to the prison.\nh3: 2018, My second time in psychiatry ward.\np: I tried to cope with the high dose epilepsy medication. I managed to taper it off, to stand back on my feet and I again wanted to give a sermon and showed the intent. I was again considered a psychiatry patient. My mother and brother started giving me the medicine without my knowledge. As soon as I felt the dose of medication in my urine, I confirmed it from them. I found out they secretly were poring high dose epilepsy medicine into my food for 3 - 4 days.\np: I surrendered and went on my own to the same Psychiatry ward for 2 months. My wife had not yet moved to Pakistan.\nh3: Building of protection wall\nh5: 1. Wife\np: I married to a Norwegian girl. She is a strong, bold, blunt and ruthless girl. She fought with the head of psychiatry doctor and lowered him to the ground. I was discharged from the hospital with positive remarks. I joined my profession back. I worked hard and got an <b>out-standing report</b> for performing an excellent job from my boss.\nh5: 2. Success at University\np: I started doing Masters. I launched <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/school target=_blank>zakatlists.com/school</a>. My university class fellows are using it. I have topped 2 subjects out of 3 in the first semester of university. I do not know yet the result of the 3rd subject.\nh5: 3. Friends over Quran\np: I joined a circle of well educated friends who read Quran everyday in the morning and read the translation. I write this blog daily where I try to write about my feelings and experiences towards Quran. The ways and means through which it has impacted my life.\np: I have my wife and these friends made over Quran, beside me. If my blog writing is abnormal, I do not believe, labelling my wife and close friends ‘abnormal’ is possible. I can not be victimised any more because of my beliefs and actions.\np: The building of this wall has made it possible for me that I keep writing a blog daily. I also arrange tech Meetups every month. I will not stop.\nh3: Conclusion\np: It is not an easy job to arrange a tech meetup every month. I am paying Rs 20000 every month out of my own pocket, because I am not a quitter. I will not lower my voice. I will not stop writing. I will not stop reading Quran. Because I am a proud guy, who inspite of getting labelled a ‘psychiatry patient’ will not get discouraged.\np: These blogs under <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com target=_blank>zakatlists.com</a> might turn out making Pakistan better. It might help Imran Khan. It might help our youth love our mosques. <b>And above all, it might unite us; from Indonesia to Palestine</b>.

        "body": "h1: Sufficient is Allah\np.note: The tone of these blogs has heated up since yesterday. I will try to keep the heavier subjects afloat.\np: Reliance on the closest people in our families is the hallmark of humans. We are social animals. The interaction between people is required to keep our social engines running. We start building reliance on friends and family members. We accumulate wealth for our children that they can live a sober life. That they do not struggle as hard as we did. It is natural for us to rely on our resources to build a fort that protects our family’s future.\np: Allah however, mentions in Quran\nquote: And Allah is most knowing of your enemies; and <span class=lavendar>sufficient is Allah as an ally, and sufficient is Allah as a helper</span>. <br> - Surah Al Nisa verse 45\nh3: Does it mean we do not work ?\np: Yes. It means we do not go to work. We do not give time to our families. We do not move ourselves. It only means, we rely on Allah. This is the only absolute meaning of the verse.\np: But, it will lead to starvation, misery and poverty. The family system will start collapsing. We will not be able to build a fort to protect our future self. It is wrong to live a life where we only rely on Allah and we do not move ourselves.\np: Before making more assumptions, let us look at the way that Prophet (PBUH) has emboldened.\nquote: A man from Bani Israel asked someone from Bani Israel to give him a loan of one thousand Dinars and the later gave it to him. The debtor went on a voyage (when the time for the payment of the debt became due) but he did not find a boat, so he took a piece of wood and bored it and <span class=lavendar>put 1000 diners in it and threw it into the sea</span>. The creditor went out and took the piece of wood to his family to be used as fire-wood.\" (See Hadith No. 488 B, Vol. 3). And the Prophet PBUH narrated the narration (and said), “When he sawed the wood, he found his money. <br> - Sahih Bukhari Book 24, Hadith 99\np: Numerous questions arise from this hadith. <span class=>I will try to enumerate them.</span>\nh6: 1. Did Bani Israel live a sober life?\np: Yes, there existed good muslims and scholars in the ummah of Musa (as). Some of these people committed grave mistakes, just like some muslims are committing grave mistakes. But they were living a life of normalcy, believing in God and His messenger.\nh6: 2. How to repay the debt?\np: Even if we are stuck on an island and we do not find means to return the debt to the creditor, we should put our money in a wooden plank and throw it into the sea.\nh6: 3. Will the creditor get the money?\np: Yes, he will get the money that we threw into the sea. He might come across our wooden plank the sea. He cuts it open and he might find his money.\nh6: 4. Is it possible to throw 1000 Dinar (5 Lac PKR) into the river?\np: It is not possible. If we do it, we will be labelled weird and not-normal. Due to the fear of losing money and reputation, we might not make it to the ‘throwing’ part.\nh3: Then, why did Prophet (PBUH) narrate this hadith?\np: The only logical reasoning of Prophet PBUH’s telling a story is; <b>he wanted us to act upon it</b>. He asked us to move eyes closed, feet naked and hand-cuffed.\np: He wanted us to throw our money into the river if this is what means to follow Allah. Our money might not reach the creditor, but we will find Allah the moment we throw our wealth away from us.\nh3: Conclusion\np: There are a lot of verses and hadiths where God and His messengers ask us to fear the God and trust Him.\np: We human beings are logical creatures. We do not literary see the God before us. It is difficult for us to act upon these instructions. We need logical reasoning for every action.\np: <b>We need to ask questions like; </b>\np.b-left: Where is God?\np.b-left: Was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) a sooth sayer, a magician or a massanger?\np.b-left: How do we believe Quran and all holy books are word of God?\np.b-left: Why do we live a life of sanity when we can live a life of fun?\np.b-left: What really is fun?\np: We need to ask these questions. Because the only way to finding Allah is walking on the path where Allah exists. <b>He exists in our books, white boards, laboratories and science projects. He exists in light and not darkness</b>.\np: The trust will only develop after we find Him. And the moment we find <b>”there exists a God”</b>, it might become difficult for us to live a life of poverty. We will become bold, brave and confident. Our actions will have the back of God, we trust. It will become easier to live a life of fun and joy.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Stop being judgemental\np.note: I am nervous, because it is a bold step. Don’t know which side this blog goes. lets see.\niframe.width-m-75.d-flex.m-auto: https://www.youtube.com/embed/xtEKKI0WmMs\np.caption.text-center: This is me writing this blog in the morning before fajar prayer\nh3: Social media is not me\np: Facebook, twitter, instagram and other social media platforms do not give our true picture. These platforms do not show us eating meals, talking to our families, doing our jobs, maintaining social circles and do exercise. We share a photo of some part of our day, makes people judge our entire life. We go on a trip, share its pictures with a smile on our face, does not mean we are always smiling on a trip.<b> It is a moment from the entire day’s trip. </b>\np: Similarly, while we post a picture on social media, we want our audience (friends, family members) to believe we are always roaming around with a happy face. <b>No body is always happy, driving his car with his wife</b>. It is not possible. The moment we show our entire day to our friends, they will realise how ugly our days go. These posts on social media does not show us fighting, being sad, wearing the bad clothes, having bad teeth and a bad smell. It only shows one side of a bigger picture.\np: I am writing this blog before Fajar prayer. I write this blog in 30 to 40 minutes while the day has not yet started. By the time I am done writing and publishing it, I have not really started my day. I have not yet prepared myself for office, talked to my wife, socialised with my friends and watched a movie. It is just the 40 minutes part of my entire day.\np: But, the moment, I share this blog with people on facebook, twitter and WhatsApp everyday, some people start getting judgemental. They perceive, “<b>I am writing it 24 / 7, round the clock</b>”. If I am not writing it, “<b>I am thinking about it. I am not getting full sleep. I am living a miserable life</b>”. But, in real, I am living a life of fights, upsets, boredoms and movies.\np: Social media do not represent me. It doesn’t represent anybody. The greatest celebrities on this earth, with a verified account, are only showing one side of their story. Their accounts does not represent them. We all are human beings. We all are just like each other; sinning, smiling, crying and fighting. We are no different from each other.\nh3: One side of the picture\np: Let us go a little higher and see from above. Our attitude of <b>being judgemental</b> has impacted our lives. We have taken a box, labelled it and placed things inside these boxes.\np: Some are <b>extremist</b>, some are<b> bad</b>, some are<b> successful</b> and some are<b> failures</b>. Different boxes, different names and different people in these boxes. For example\nh5: 1. Quran is an extremist book or Quran is a book difficult to act upon\np: We have not read the Quran entirely. Some of us are muslims, because we are appointed a <b>Muslim</b> by our parents. Some of us are christians, because we are labelled so by our parents.\np: None of us know; what Quran, Bible, Torah and Zabur speak about. We have read only 1 version / 1 translation of these books. We have labelled it ‘boring’, ‘extremist’, ‘difficult to act upon’ book.\np: No body knows, not even the greatest scholar know, what Islam means. <b>Islam has not yet met its end. It is still being discovered.</b>\nh5: 2. Pakistan is a failing economy\np: We are not always failing. Our stock market goes up some parts of the year. It is lower today, but 4 months back it went up to 40000 points. It goes up, comes down and again goes up. We can not fixate the label of a ‘<b>failing</b>’ economy to Pakistan. <b>Pakistan is a flourishing state, named the best tourist place for year 2020.</b>\nh5: 3. The boxer who punched the weak guy that his blood gushes out\np.note: This part was narrated by my brother that he saw a boxer in a club, punching a poor guy. His blood gushed open and people got mad at the boxer.\np: The boxer is not always punching the weaker ones. He pays his fares, talks to his family, earns money and spends it on himself. He sleeps, talks, cries and lives a life. His one time hitting a person, does not make him an evil person. He turned evil in a moment, and later he is a normal human being. His most actions are loveable and forgive-able.\nh5: 4. The prostitute will go to hell\np: No she will not go to hell. We do not know what they do. How they live their lives. They might be are more humble, more human and more loveable than us.\nh5: 5. Atheists will go to hell\np: We do not know yet. We do not know the Quran yet. We do not know how Allah works. How can we be so sure they will go to hell? They might go to paradise.\nh3: Stop it\np: We need to stop labelling people. We do not know what any of us is going through.\np: I am a small kid inside myself. I know myself, who needs to be loved, considered human being and needs to be encouraged. I know we all are like me, <b>small inside</b>. We need help, give us help. Give us love, that we listen to you.\np.lavendar: My blog is only 40 minutes of my entire day. I am not these blogs.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project. Please follow this project's page on twitter. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zakatlists\">Click here to go to the twitter page</a>.

        "body": "h1: Justifying Imran Khan\np.note: Yesterday UN General Seceretary Antonio Guterres was visiting various places in Pakistan beside Imran Khan. I wanted to explain it religiously but it needs colors we all can see.\nimg.width-m-half: Antonio.png\np.caption.text-center: <a href=https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1229730148964012034?s=20 target=_blank>Link to the tweet here</a>\np: Imran Khan, like Donald Trump, has always been the low cast, immature and spoiled kid in the world of politics. Donald Trump, I kept calling him, <b>he will fail</b>, did not fail. He made it all the way to the <b>President</b> of USA. Imran Khan is a similar story. Everyone called him a <b>failure</b> until we saw him rule 1 x province of Pakistan. But, the virus of PTI (Pakistan Tehreek Insaf) did not stop there. It seeped into other provinces. He is now the sitting <b>Prime Minister of Pakistan</b>.\nh3: Why did he not fail?\np: He has not succeeded yet. But how did he move up there.\nimg.width-half: imrankhanbook.jpg\np: I was reading this biography of <a href=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=5ptqDuf48RMC&dq=biography+of+imran+khan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx1sKysNznAhVDgRoKHTLPCK0Q6AEILDAB target=_blank> Imran Khan by Christopher Sandford</a>; where he narrated an incident on the cricket ground. He called all the players for their opinion. Heard them. Acknowledged them. But went his own way. He always had a plan in his mind, <b>to execute</b>. Against all odds, suggestions and favors, <b>he walked on his own beaten road</b>. Invisible to his players, fellows and colleagues. He just walked with his head down to the glory of 1992 World Cup.\np: In 1999, we had all the best cricket stars but we lacked Imran Khan in the field, beside the great players to unite them and bring them to glory.\np: Imran Khan has been divorced twice, that means he did not even listen to his wives. <b>He did not stop</b>, is one reason that made him all things, he is today.\nh3: Who all are failing / failed?\np: <b>Nawaz Sharif</b>, is on exile. Running for his life. Hiding in abroad. Wants to bring his daughter back, can’t convince anyone. He can’t return to Pakistan, he will go back to prison.\np: <b>Zardari</b>, is the name of a land grabber mafia. Sitting in prison. Each passing day, he gets another blow on his reputation and freedom. Tired, failing and falling.\np: <b>Modi</b> is dejecting world leaders from entering India. They are denouncing him for all the brutalities and cruelties against minorities in India. Not just the Muslims, the educated lot is under attack. About to fall, dwindle and diminish.\np: <b>All the people</b> trying to bring Imran Khan down for his efforts, are failing everyday.\np: <b>Opposition is greedy</b>, is another reason for Imran Khan’s so far success.\nh3: Justifying Imran Khan\np: He is bringing delegations. Every day he is standing on the rostrum, speaking. Convincing us to have patience. Each day he is blown hard from all sides. He is re-affirmed, his actions are wrong. Each day people are unwilling to remove luxuries from their lives, cut down their finances, sacrifice on their benefits, label Imran Khan ‘Wrong’. Each passing moment he is dragged hard by us, we people who can not want to see a change.\np: He needs help. Bring your money, benefits, children to him. He talks of Madina, bring your life to him. He talks of Islam and its successes, what stops you from giving him the momentum he needs. He is going to win. Just few days ahead, he is going to convince the world of <b>the beauty</b> that lies in the foundations of our religion. The world might know, it might realize, it might get that sleek light that shined in Badr, Baghdad and Yarmouk. The world might feel, what it feels to live in harmony, rythem, abundance and love. They might see what the world of God looks like. Imran Khan might make this world the rock that Allah wants it to be. He might make millions proud of God. He might…\np: He is there to succeed. Say what ever you want to say. People came and went on. They tried to lower the Mujahideen in the past. They struggled to break the momentum. They failed. It rocked in the past. It will rock hard again. Bring it down. You can not.\nh3: Conclusion\np: We be good, we succeed. We be greed, we fail. It is no rocket science but plain old simple math. Speak good, be kind and act sober. No power on earth can undo a good human being. No resistance can survive and beat this wall down. It goes up and that is the only way history has worked. Winston Churchill, against all odds and thugs, sits in a public transit, seeks opinion and acts. Might be drunk, but saves entire Kingdom.\np: It does not take to be a great scholar, philosopher or education, it takes one moment to become good. In a moment, we can undo all of ourselves. We can feel great and fight great. Just a moment, makes us a millionaire. It is not science. It is history speaking or it is <span class=lavendar>Quran</span> speaking.\nquote: Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of Taghut. So fight against the allies of Satan. Indeed, <span class=lavendar>the plot of Satan has ever been weak</span>. <br> - Surah Al Nisa verse 76\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Believing in angels\nimg: angelsunsplash.png\np.caption.text-center: Search result of word ‘angels’ on unsplash.com\np: This is a famous website where you can find high quality pictures from normal photographers for free. The search result of word ‘<b>angels</b>’ shows a woman, with two wings, delicate and beautiful. ‘<b>Wings</b>’ always resonate with the word ‘angel’.\np: Other than wings, we, believers, also consider them the creatures who are extra ordinarily serving the Almighty Allah. They can not commit a mistake and they are always making the ‘will of God’ come true.\np: Above all, these are the creatures that are resourceful, never die, abundant in strength and have the might to shake the world in an instant. <b>Hazrat Israfil (as)</b> is the angel who has been assigned to blow the horn. He is holding his breath for one task, <b>to bring Qayyamah</b>.\nh3: Jins also..\np: There is next supernatural creature, mentioned abundantly in Quran, movies or our horror stories called as <b>Jins (ghosts)</b>. We believe they are made of fire. They can roam around just like human beings. They can not be seen. The evil ghosts harm people. Good ghosts protect people. They also read Quran and will be judged on the grounds of their affiliation with the book / books of Allah.\np: They are physically moving, but are invisible for us. We have to consider them around us.\nh3: What is the problem?\np: The basic problem with all these stories is these stories are against the law of nature and understandings of science. These do not go in line with all our life’s effort. The work done in our laboratories, schools, homes, during our upbringing; do not go with the understanding of these creatures. We are physically living people, bound to logical thoughts, always putting in our entire effort towards understanding the ‘nature’. But we are told to believe in ’super-nature’.\np: I being a Telecom Engineer, Web developer, studying courses on Udemy and university, can not apprehend the word angels and jins. I did not see them. I am only told, ‘these exist’. But my entire life’s work is focused on the understanding of ‘Nature’; earning for my household, my job, social interactions, subjects in my university, assignments and priorities. I never <b>focused</b> on the angels and the jins.\np: I can not answer this question:- <b>Why do I believe in Angels and Jins?</b>\np: I am left in a void of finding them forever. Never truly grasping the meaning of their existence.\nh3: The major problem\nquote: Indeed, those whom the <span class=lavendar>angels take [in death] </span>while wronging themselves - [the angels] will say, “<span class=lavendar>In what [condition] were you?</span>” They will say, “<span class=lavendar>We were oppressed in the land</span>.” The angels will say, “<span class=lavendar>Was not the earth of Allah spacious [enough] for you to emigrate therein?</span>” For those, <span class=lavendar>their refuge is Hell</span> - and evil it is as a destination. <br> - Surah Al Nisa verse 97\np: This verse tells us to:-\np.b-left: <b>1. Believe in angels</b>, that they exist in all their might.\np.b-left: <b>2. Migrate to a land of no oppression</b>, that if we die wronging ourselves, we will be sent to the hell.\np.b-left: <b>3. Believe the earth of Allah is spacious</b>, that even if we give up tax bindings, property, siblings and a stable life; we will still be finding shelter in abundance on Allah’s earth.\np: The grave issue is; <b>if I do not believe in angels and jins</b>, I can not succeed. But I am unable to believe. I am unable to compromise a stable life over a life of certainty promised by Quran.\np: I can not give up my property, siblings, shelter and a stable life. I can not migrate, until I get the certainty that I will be brought comfort and peace through a super natural force of angels.\nh3: But..\np: I know, we all know, these angels are there above us. These are protecting us and helping us. They have intervened in our physical world in the past, and they are still managing the complex mesh of this world.\np: We know, this earth can not survive without an outer force. It will collapse the next moment we are left on our own; without principles, rules and policies. The nature that governs us, has a root. We are not focusing on the root.\np: Our life is not pointed towards finding the <b>magic</b> that can literally break the laws of nature and provide for us, <b>ways to the success</b>. We are not focused on the angels, jins and the universe of abundance that has huge to explore. But not explored at all.\nh3: Conclusion\np: It is not easy to believe in angels. Believing in angels means; believing in there literal intervention into our world that they find means and ways for us. We jump higher with our eyes closed. We walk blind we will succeed. We move and Allah will provide for us.\np: <b><span class=lavendar>Believing means</span></b>, there is a huge opportunity to be explored to getting rich in material and spirit. An untouched domain is there to be explored, <b>that will only open after <span class=lavendar>we close our eyes</span>.</b>\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Healing the fabrics\np.note: This topic can make our lives better. Please brothers and sisters listen..\nimg.width-m-half: forts.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@alirezapasandeh?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText target=_blank>Alireza Pasandeh</a> on Unsplash\np: There are small forts in our lives, like the one above. Each fort has walls around it, the anchors and the oil trench with spear headings protecting it from offensives. Some forts are built higher and some are built weaker. The forts that are bigger in size, control a little more of the land around them. They govern some more rules than the smaller forts.<b> Bigger forts do not break easily. They are taken down only in wars. They lead the trust of the people. </b>\np: Our families, friends and relationships are these forts. Each husband and wife is an institution residing in this fort. The brother, might be the most miserable person on the earth, is your line of defence against your bigger enemies. The sisters, who might do not speak their entire lives, are the best fighters to protect our institutions. The friends, who may criticise you at times, are your friends to protect your institution. Each person we interact, creates a pulse of emotions, memories and sparks that can protect only us.\np: I am talking selfish, totally focused on my own success. The success of my self, is only possible after I build a strong fort with good roads, better rules and long lasting relations. I can not succeed without the existence of an institution. I can not walk for my entire life without the help of my wife, my brother and my cousin. Each relationship makes me a success. Every single bond makes me human. I can not talk loud to anybody, if I am so in love with my own success. The moment, I break a laid down principle, I react in anger, I make this crack in the fort that takes significant effort to repair.\nh3: But some people are really bad\np: Yes some hurt us more than others. Some even beat us to the ground. Some bully us in public. Some throw dust at us. Some are evil. Some are dancing in the mosques. Yes there are people who make us angry and are really bad.\np.note: How do I say it…\np: They are the people who have a human underneath their skin. Some serial killers who are stuck in prisons, when they cry, they bring you down with them. The tears falling from great chests and strong shoulders are the heaviest. Some who killed our brothers and sisters on spearheads. They murdered them in public. These killers became the best fighters and commanders in wars.\np: These same murderers and killers when raised their voices, they shook into the hearts of the enemies. They shook this earth. Their voice moved hearts. Their wives loved them. Their people followed them into destruction. They died leading a battalion of 400 people and all 400 of their people died with them. <b>Ikram (ra) after becoming a war criminal, became a commander in Battle of Yarmouk</b>. He died like no body of us can die. His voice was the loudest in the crowd. The moment he stood his ground, enemy could not stand with all its might. All 70,000 were down. We won Jerusalem and we raised higher.\nimg.width-m-half: yarmouk.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Ikrama (ra) on 4th Day of battle in Yarmouk, snippet from <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Sword-Allah-I-Akram/dp/0195977149 target=_blank>The Sword of Allah</a>\np: These murderers have a human underneath their skin. The worst attackers have the human part. Look at the emotions they carry. The tears they drop. The love they give. Look at how they protect you when you are falling.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Each relationship is a meaningful relationship. The person meeting us on the road to the wife inside our home. All these people are independent forts. We need to build stronger forts and harder institutions that we rise higher in this world. We can not do it alone, we need help of these other forts around us. We need to heal the roads leading to these other cities and towns. These fabrics woven into our hearts, needs to warmth. We need to forgive others. The forgiveness that puts a dent into their hearts. The dent that lasts an eternity and leads all of us to the success.\np: It is not possible, we heal these fabrics right away. It takes time. Give your relationships everything you can that they protect you. Only you will be benefitted. Be selfish. So that, only <b>you</b> succeed.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Communication skills\np.note: This is interesting. Let’s talk about how do we make our talks more meaningful..\np: I have always been a weak speaker on stage, in public and family gatherings. I suffered a lot. I couldn’t convince my family in early days of my childhood to let me study in peace. I was sent to a boarding school where I had to sit on floor for 2 long restricted years. I underwent some difficulties and made it to a good university in Pakistan.\np: Next challenge was to face my university class fellows, teachers and again the same family members. I did not work on my communication skills that lead me to fighting for what was mine, every day. I wanted more of everything. Weaker communication skills impacted my childhood, teen hood and until recently my adult hood.\np: It had become hard to convince people of my intentions. My right intentions at times were perceived as wrong and evil plans. When I failed to convince others, I ended up fighting and disrespecting others.\nh3: How did I fix it?\np: I talked about only those things which are correct. Like I started talking about Quran, goodness and fixing the society. The ideas that can impact our lives. While I was struggling to establish my own luxuries through talking about only good things, I ended up learning to code. This incident of 2017, to learn to code, gave me an edge over most of the criticism around me. People I argued with before, did not know how to code. By making it possible for myself, to make a website from scratch and publish it to the web, I took a lead over all the criticism.\np: But the criticism did not stop there. It wanted me to further improve my communication skills. I coded a little more harder. Picked another course on web development to learn a new programming skill called as ‘Nodejs’. It also drastically impacted my life.\np: But, still the criticism did not lower any bit. I did not stop on these blows and kept on making good websites.\np: This cycle of responding to criticism with programming and colouring pages, helped me get a little more ahead of these people. I managed to further my self esteem, gain self confidence and each day my speech started getting better. The construction of sentences, their meanings and purpose was all there. I started gaining momentum.\np: The habit of coding every day with the collaboration of communities like <a href=https://www.getmakerlog.com target=_blank>getmakerlog.com</a> where I found more people like me, I managed to give my life a direction. People who were criticising me in 2017, are still criticising me. But their criticism has made me run  <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com target=_blank>zakatlists.com</a> better. <span class=note>For example I am about to launch the next thoroughly thought-out upgrade of this website</span>.\np: The presence of programming skill, has made it easier for me to move around with all the criticism.\nh3: Should you find people to criticise you?\np: No.. Do not find criticism. It is the natural response of every good thing you do consistently, non stop and most part of your lives. You do not have to <b>find</b> for it. <b>You have to find the purpose in your life</b>, that gives your life a meaning. As soon as you start walking on this purpose, your life will start getting successful. You will have more skills, confidence and strength to keep walking with your head held high.\nh3: Conclusion\np: To improve the communication skills, we need to work on <b>giving meaning to our life</b>. A purpose, that defines us. Purpose, agenda of life, resolutions and hobbies are these small ingredients that make our speeches interesting and meaningful.\np: You want to talk about colors; you can start with a resolution to paint the street in your neighbourhood with colors of your choice. As soon as you start painting one street with bright colors, you will find more streets. Each street will have people to repel you. The fight and hardened resolute to paint the streets, will improve your vocabulary, skill set and self esteem. You will start painting better, your choice of colors will improve and the people who repel you, will keep on acting reactive, repulsive and abusive.\np: In order to rise in this world, we need to have good communication skills, followed by a physical skill set that raises you in your society and before all these skills, a purpose. The one purpose that gives your life a meaning.\nquote: No good is there in much of their<span class=lavendar> private conversation</span>, except for those who <span class=lavendar>enjoin charity</span> or that <span class=lavendar>which is right</span> or <span class=lavendar>conciliation between people</span>. And whoever does that seeking means to the approval of Allah - then We are going to give him a great reward. <br> - Surah Al Nisa verse 114\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: How to make Pakistan better.\np.note: A brother reached me on twitter inbox for help. He wants to start a blog. So..\np: This is year 2020. In Pakistan, Internet is accessible in most homes. Islamabad has a dedicated Fiber network laid by <a href=https://nayatel.com/ targe=_blank>#Nayatel</a>. PTCL is offering a minimum of 8 Mbps bundle in almost all cities. It has reached to farthest areas of Pakistan, including war torn places like Miranshah, Razmak and Dir. A nominal connection fee of Rs 2800 per month, brings with it numerous possibilities. Today, if you are wasting your time watching Netflix, you really are missing out on hundreds of dollars. 2020 is the year to make your dreams come true. Be with me, I will narrate with you some tips to bring colors to your life.\nh3: Write blogs\np: Blog writing is the most attractive marketing platform to show your presence. This website is only working because of these blogs. You should write blogs if you want to see your business excelling.\np: Follow these steps to start blogging.\np.b-left: <b>1. Go to <a href=https://www.medium.com target=_blank>Medium.com</a></b> and make your account with a good quality DSLR photo.\np.b-left: <b>2. Go to <a href=https://www.twitter.com target=_blank>twitter.com</a></b> and make another account with the same picture you used for your above Medium.com account.\np.b-left: <b>3. Write </b>about your favourite feature in Pakistan on Medium. You can also write about <b>women suffering in your area</b>. May be<b> importance of education for children and women</b>. <br>Find a good niche that attracts you as a hobby and put it into words. Wrong structure of sentences, bad grammer and boring subjects should not stop you from writing. These are beginner fears.\np.b-left: <b>4. Write a #resulution post on twitter</b> like <a href=https://twitter.com/zakatlists/status/1216308030247251969?s=20 target=_blank> this one</a>. For example write:- <br><b class=twitter>”Next 365 days, I will write every week twice about my favorite niche, subjects or topics and share it on medium. Follow me on my medium profile to stay tuned.”<br><span class=note>Attach link to your medium profile below the post<span></b>.\np.b-left: <b>5. Take a screen shot </b>of the post with your own picture and <b>share it on whatsapp, facebook and instagram statuses</b>. All places where you are more vulnerable to negative remarks if you fail. <b>This will bind you</b> to your commitment.\np.b-left: <b>6. Share the post you wrote on <a href=https://www.medium.com target=_blank>Medium.com</a></b> with all these people. <br>Do not ask for feedback. Do not listen to remarks. Do not open your eyes to criticism. Go blind on people’s response.\np.b-left: <b>7. Most importantly</b>, share all these posts on twitter with a hashtag of <a href=https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DigitalPakistan&src=typeahead_click target=_blank>#digitalpakistan</a>. Twitter is an excellent platform to reach out to people of huge value. Real celebrities will start taking notice of your writings and you will find multiple doors opening to you. I have met <a href=https://twitter.com/fajarsiddiqFS target=_blank>@Fajar</a> from Singapore. He has huge following and he is helping me run my personal platforms.\np: This is it. For now, I will suggest you <b>only commit to these 7 points and start writing</b>. After 1 month of staying committed to this resolution, contact me to discuss your progress. I will be so happy to help you further your resolution.\nh3: If you do not want to write blogs?\np: You should do following:-\np.b-left: <b>1. Go to your favourite platform that matches your interest and join a community</b>.\np.b-left: <b>2 - 7. Do all remaining things</b> that I have laid out for writing blog posts.\np.b-left: <b>Contact me </b>if you need help.\nh3: Important point\np: Good blogs, drawings, films, vlogs and podcasts do not come true the first day. No body in the world is more talented than you. Your own idea, mind and thoughts are totally unique. Your thoughts stand out in the crowd. Your business, with good values and honest principles will attract people towards it.\np: Writing good blogs is not a time taking activity. It is only 30 to 40 minutes of daily work. Find a time in the day where you get no disturbance from others, your own personal time. Write about your favorite niche and share it with people. <b>Your friends need it more then you yourself need it</b>.\nh3: Make use of Pakistan\np: Pakistan is an amazing country. I recently went to Hunza and Khunjarab. I found beautiful camping locations for nomading. <span class=lavendar>Sweet tooth cafe</span> beside attabad lake, like the one below, is an ideal cafe for you to bring life to your art. You sit on your laptop, have the view of pulse wrecking waters meeting the mountains right in front of you. The beauty of these places will bring life to your work.\nimg: sweettooth.jpg\np.caption.text-center: <a href=https://www.facebook.com/sweettoothattabad/ target=_blank>Sweet Tooth Cafe - Attabad Lake</a>\np: In Hunza, I found another place by the name of ‘<a href=https://www.facebook.com/watch/Urban-Escape-Passu-364023433764320/ target=_blank class=lavendar>Urban Escape’</a>. It is being run by a University Student in Islamabad. He invites people from Southern Pakistan to spend a week or two with him. You can go to him in a nominal cost, stay with him for two weeks and write about your experiences in your blog.\np: <b>Your business will only work if it is a reflection of your personal priorities and values</b>. As you start gaining momentum you will be able to live independently. No more hands tied to boring jobs and timeless hours of sitting in cubicles. As soon as your business starts working, attract people towards it and build a community. Ultimately, you will be able to bring value to Pakistan and make it better.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: What I felt in Mecca during Umrah..\nimg.width-half: mecca.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@izuddinhelmi?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText target=_blank>Izuddin Helmi Adnan</a> on Unsplash\np: I can’t tell about all these people, but I am sure about myself, ‘<b>I am confused</b>’. I recently came back from Mecca after performing Umrah. I was told about the shockingly amazing experience one experiences on the first sight of Kaaba. I was unable to find the spiritual lift that would bring me to tears and crying. It was just another normal experience; of a mix of curiosity and amusement. But to say, I went down crying in shock, would be wrong. I did not experience it.\np: 3 or 4 days are down and I am unable to get the spiritual shock to reset my internal self. No shocks, jolts and movements. All days of stay in Mecca were normal days. I performed umrah thrice and moved to Madina.\np: Madina experience was again similar to Mecca. There were no spiritual lifts, but routine rituals, obligations and prayers. In my 14 days of trip to Mecca and Madina, last year in November, I did not get the feel I wanted. I did not break in repentance. My prayers were routine prayers. I, however, had gained a traveller’s experience of finding historical places and uniqueness of these two cities.\nh3: Why did I fail to grasp the might of Mecca and Madina?\np: May be, I am wrong here. But I believe all the earth is similar. The pyramids in Egypt to temples in Tibbet have nothing more spiritual and magical than the town I am living in right now. I believe, we cry in Mecca only because of our want to cry. We try to connect dots and weave links to revive what it was like in Prophet’s era and we shed few tears here and there. It is a normal reaction to witnessing places of gigantic value. We find the links and connections to our beliefs. We try to connect the dots to bring the emotional-self out. But, in real, all these places are just like any other place in this world.\nh3: Did I grasp anything during my trip to Mecca and Madina?\np: I found the most important ingredient I had always wanted in my life. I was soul searching at times. I would ask my teachers and colleagues but no body had the answer. I thought it is the lack of answer that is keeping myself from completely entering into Islam. I did not believe entirely and I had doubts in my heart. The religion and life were two different subjects. I perceived, subject of Islam is difficult whereas the subject of life is easier. Such thoughts would cross my mind to keep myself from embracing any of the two subjects. It was a feeling of lost, never ending struggle to bring myself back on the track. I was failing.\np: The ingredient I found in Mecca and Madina was ‘<b class=lavendar>the realisation of the lack of answers’</b>. I realised this entire world is stone and dust. It is all similar. One place does not surpass the might and majesticness of another place. I found, Mecca and Madina are no different than Pakistan. These are places just like all other places on earth.\np: I realised, it is <b class=lavendar>myself</b> who matters the most in my world. The ‘myself’ will make some places Kaaba, some places pyramids and some places temples. It is ‘myself’ that will be held accountable. No one is there to protect me from ‘myself’, not even Kaaba. No one is there to bring me to hold, as I will be falling. I am nose diving into my own destruction. Madina and Mecca did not bring me to halt. Therefore, no thing bigger in the world will be able to keep me from falling. I concluded; <b>It is only me, who will defeat me, to save me.</b>\np: I found the meaning of the hadith of Prophet (PBUH)\nquote: Prophet (P.B.U.H) said to his companions when they returned from a military campaign, “<span class=lavendar>We have come back from the lesser jihad to the greater jihad.</span>” They said, “<span class=lavendar>Is there any greater jihaad than jihad against the kuffar?</span>” he said, “<span class=lavendar>Yes, jihad al-nafs</span> (jihad against the self).” <br>\nh3: Mecca that can change me\np: The haram that will shake inside of me to bring me back to the path of Quran, is not in Mecca or Madina. It does not exist anywhere else but inside me. The mecca residing inside my-self needs to be covered with a purer cloth, cleaner floor and a broader window. This mecca of ‘self’ needs to be found to shake inside of me. No Haram and No Madina but the nafs. No protection from others but to protect self. No success from others but to jump myself. This is what I found in Mecca. This is why I am running zakatlists to unite muslims, in’sha’Allah..\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

It is a book that teaches physics, meta physics, humanitarianism and wisdom. It is not poetry and it can not be cherry picked. I will talk about all the words in the topic 👆 today because all these words are an image of each other. I came across these words through yesterday’s experiences. Like yesterday I read in Quran about justice:-\nquote: O you who have believed, <span class=lavendar>be persistently standing firm in justice</span>, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. <br> - Surah Al Nisa verse 135\np: After the Quran, in a sitting with a friend, I came across the word <b class=lavendar>Balance</b>. Then another friend quoted the need to be <b class=lavendar>Happy</b>. All these scenarios are in wanting of <b class=lavendar>Success</b>.\np: Before I move to explaining their equality, let me define the meaning of their imbalance.\nh3: A miserable life\np.b-left: <b>1. </b>You are living a miserable life, if <b>you do not have any goal in your life</b>. Find a goal to work on it everyday. Something that brings colors to your day.\np.b-left: <b>2. </b>You are living a miserable life, if <b>you have a goal and you are over doing its pursuit</b>. Your family, profession and health is suffering because you are coding / painting most part of the day.\np.b-left: <b>3. </b>You are living a miserable life, if you are <b>unable to maintain a balance</b> in all areas of importance of your life.\np: If you are running everyday and your pillars of the day are shaking, your life will collapse sooner than you know. You need to strengthen these pillars that you do not collapse. Misery does not over run you. You do not find yourself lost. It is a red big warning poster hanging right in front of you. <b class=lavendar>Miserable Life = Failure</b>.\nh3: Pillars of your day\np: We all have these three pillars in our day. Each pillar needs our warmth, love and sympathies to stand firm.\np.b-left: <b>1. <span class=lavendar>Family<span></b> is the first pillar. Wife, kids and parents. They need you around them to watch a movie, cook breakfast, take them to park and do homework with them.\np.b-left: <b>2. <span class=lavendar>Profession<span></b> is the next pillar. It needs your attention and focus to move ahead. You also need it to live a stable and a happier life.\np.b-left: <b>3. <span class=lavendar>Goal<span></b> to become the best developer in the world. It is a pillar. It has to exist. Life is incomplete without this pillar.\nh3: The balance\np: All these pillars are equally important. They need a balance. If one pillar is shaking because you are building another pillar, you are living a miserable life. You will not achieve success. You are moving towards failure.\np: In order to succeed, you need to focus on becoming happy. You need to protect your wife from sadness and misery. She will make you happy everyday with a smile on her face. She will come to the gate in morning while you will be leaving for office. She will stand beside you and fall beside you. She is a pillar. Your kids and your parents are in need of you. Without your presence around them, they are failing.\np: Profession and your goal of life also carry exactly same weightage. They need your warmth and protection to take you ahead. The momentum to your success is only possible after all these 3 pillars are succeeding because of your contributions.\nh3: It is not possible?\np: May be not possible today. It was not possible for me 2 months back. My life was in shambles. Profession was nose diving. Zakatlists (this website) had no traffic. I and my wife, we were fighting most part of our days. But today, all these pillars are standing firm and I am more happier than I have ever been in my life. Profession is going up. Zakatlists is gaining momentum. My wife and I are watching movies, roaming shops and cooking breakfasts.\nh3: My ingredient of making it\nimg.width-m-half: 30 days challenge.jpg\np.text-center.caption: My ingredient\np: I started with 30 Days Challenge of saying 5 prayers with Jammaat. It has moved inside out of me. There is more rhythm and courage. Staying committed to my promises and duties is becoming easier. All these pillars are moving side by side. I am managing to achieve more in less time. My brain is more focused. Health is getting better. Life is becoming happier.\np: If you are not a muslim, I suggest, you start with some similar challenge for next 30 days. Do it consistently and mark a cross on calendar every day. After 30 days, you will be standing at a different place in your life. It will turn around. All things will make you happier and you will succeed sooner.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

It is only one way spendings. In the middle, I freeze it due to lack of fundings and other personal projects running in parallel. After one month, I brought it back online. These confusions and lack of motivation did not help at all. I wasted tons of hours to hit a dead end.\nimg.width-m-600: twitter7Dec.png\np.caption.text-center: Days of going down and getting back up\np: Since 7 December 2019, I have been working on this project for most part of the days. It is now gaining momentum and most of my friends have started discussing its vision in gatherings. Zakatlists is now getting acknowledgement. Traffic graph is going up and I am feeling better every morning. 10 to 20 people per week in December 2019 has gone up to 20 to 30 people per day.\np: I will take you to the point throught 4 aveneus of inspiration\np.b-left: 1. <b>Ethen</b> running Kanban Mail\np.b-left: 2. <b>The Lean Startup</b> by Eric Ries\np.b-left: 3. Message in <b>Quran</b>\np.b-left: 4. Actions of <b>a leader</b>\nh3: 1. The tip to success by Ethen\np: Yesterday I read an article from oyestartups. According to <a href=https://twitter.com/Booligoosh target=_blank>Ethen</a>, running kanbanmail, an email client;\nimg: ethen.png\np.caption.text-center: Read this article at <a href= target=_blank>oyestartups</a>\np: Ethen faces a problem in school. Makes a product in 2018. Launches it in 10 months. Grabs audience and is earning nearly $ 176 Monthly Recurring Revenue.\np: Right after this read, I look at myself and label myself a novice developer who has not done any worthwhile project his entire life. No influx of income, zero MRR and all down hill run since starting zakatlists. I am also 16 years older to him, twice his age and I am equally capable. Still, all these failures.. Are they worth it?\nh3: 2. Is it necessary to run with no income for so long? - The Lean Startup\np: I think, it is wrong. The projects are worth succeeding. They fail because either they lack your personality’s touch or you are not developing the attitude to lead your projects. A project or a business is a reflection of your personal self. The more transparent and human you make your businesses, the sooner they will start succeeding.\nimg: leanstartup.png\np.caption.text-center: We discussed it during <a href=https://www.meetup.com/techshek/events/267878904/ target=_blank>1st meetup</a> of this year; <a href=http://theleanstartup.com/ target=_blank>The Lean Startup</a>\np: It is not wise to be wasteful most hours of your days. It is also not wise to be wasteful most days of your year. Read <b>Lean Startup</b>. It focuses on iteration, increasing the cycle of creating, launching and failing. It talks of failing more often, that we increase the probability of succeeding more often.\nh3: 3. Another book says - The Quran\nquote: Indeed, those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and wish to discriminate between Allah and His messengers and say, “<span class=lavendar>We believe in some and disbelieve in others</span>,” and <span class=lavendar>wish to adopt a way in between</span>. <br> - Surah Al Nisa verse 150\np: This book focuses on adopting a project in its <b>entirety</b>. <b class=lavendar>There is no middle way</b>. We can not skip marketing through blogs, networking, sharing on whatsapp, and talking loud. Only focusing on continous coding takes a toll on your health. Coding coupled with the humanly touch brings colors to your projects.\np: The less compromising path is the longest path. Sooner we adopt to the right path, the sooner we will be making our businesses tick.\nh3: 4. Gandhi says - A leader\nquote: Happiness is when what you <span class=lavendar> think</span>, what you <span class=lavendar>speak</span> and what you <span class=lavendar>do </span>are in harmony.\np: For Gandhi, to make it to leading millions around him, convincing everyone of them about his struggle to freedom had been impossible. He found only one way to success. He carried one version of himself. He did not perform bad transactions and gave false hopes. He made it to independent India by becoming more <b class=lavendar>transparent</b>.\nh3: Conclusion\np: All successful entrepreneurs, leaders and great books want us to go completely transparent. <b>Our transactions, dealings, business cards, websites and twitter handles need to act human</b>. Bots, professionalism-misinterpreted, shyness and lack of courage only dulls down the color of your business. It needs to be more in human who is fuelling its engines. It should fly higher, run faster and meet success sooner. Delaying it, only delays the colors it can bring to your life.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Humility and humbleness\np.note: I am struggling with these two parts to adopt. I am easily getting angry and reactive to losses. Like yesterday someone dropped water on my macbook and I found myself impulsive. I am still trying to cope with the loss. Today’s topic is about Quran and self correction.\np: Before I move to explaining the topic, a brief overview is required to explain the verse in discussion today. I read this tweet from Sahil Lavingia on twitter\nimg: sahil.png\np.caption.text-center: <a href=https://twitter.com/shl/status/1230003215027978241?s=20 target=_blank>Link here</a>\np: Simple is not easy. It is easy to read Quran, but it is not simple to work on it. It is easy to get a meaning out of its verse, but it is not simple to adopt it. Easy refers to judging others, <b>simple means to taking responsibility for the change you want to see in others</b>.\np: I recently had established a fact;\np.b-left: Holding tight to Quran, makes bearing losses easy.\np: However, after losing the instrument that was driving me forward in pursuing my purpose, I have realised I failed. I failed miserably. I am still worried, I am not prepared enough to bear such losses in future.\nquote: And as for those who <span class=lavendar>believed</span> and did <span class=lavendar>righteous</span> deeds, He will give them in full their rewards and grant them extra from His bounty. But as for those who <span class=lavendar>disdained</span> and were <span class=lavendar>arrogant </span>, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will not find for themselves besides Allah any protector or helper. <br> - Surah Al Nisa verse 173\np: It seems simple, to believe. It is easier to label myself a muslim, a follower of a book, but it is not simple to embrace. To put labels for heaven and hell is easier but to embrace to losses hinged with the beliefs are difficult. Life seems easy in a nutshell, but the shell is oval, porous and windy inside. It is not simple to construct and heal the porous shell of life.\np: Believing is a dangerous act. It leads to chaos, if it is done incorrect. The lack of faith behind our self imposed label, can prove destructive. The linking of faith and mask we are putting on our faces, needs tremendous effort to bridge. Our life is incomplete if we are putting on a mask of ‘<b class=lavendar>Believer</b>’ and letting ‘<b class=lavendar>Faith</b>’ go down a sloppy hill.\nh3: Faith > Humility\np: I can only become humble and embrace humility, if I build a better wall around my faith. The wall to protect me from confusions and detractions. This wall needs to be built every day where I am reminded of my ‘Belief’, my mask of ‘Muslim’ and its root inside me. Each day this wall needs to go higher and wider. <b>The door to humility, humbleness, success and concentrated focus, only opens after I let my Faith in ‘<span class=lavendar>Right</span>’ grow strong. </b>\np: I have reached a conclusion through these past failures, critiques, negativity and pulls, I need to keep moving more humble and more human. I need to build my wall of ‘Faith’ higher, behind my self imposed mask of ‘Muslim’ that I can live a life of <b class=voilet>colors</b>.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: The table of Peace\np.note: We have completed 4 x Surahs in nearly 2 months. Today we are starting Surah Al Maida, 5th Surah of Quran. It has 120 x Verses and 16 x Rakus. It is a Madni Surah.\nimg.width-half: peace.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@_javardh_001?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText target=_blank>Javardh</a> on Unsplash\np: Before moving to the topic, take a moment to read following points to understand how our Creator talks to us;\np.b-left: <b>Verse 1.</b> Fulfil all your contracts.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 2.</b> Do not cooperate in sin and aggression.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 3.</b> Do not fear your enemies, but fear Me.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 4.</b> Allah is swift in account.\np.b-left: <b>Verse 5.</b> Do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse or take in [secret] lovers.\np: Face to face, right in front me, a commandment given to me, expecting I will listen to it; is how Allah talks in Quran. He knows our purpose more than we do. He made us thinking we will listen to Him and make Him proud. He against all odds and against all negations, made us His messengers on His earth. He knows our vision, belief and weaknesses. He knows our darkest side, the side that sheds blood of weaker. Yet He brought us to make Him proud.\np: Above verses are simple instructions. Any hindu beating muslim in India will find these verses readable and understandable. Any muslim in Mayamar dying at the hands of Racisim would understand its meaning. We all know these moments are temporary that are moving at a lightening speed. With all the moments and all the deaths, leaving us behind, we do not want to recall; <b>We were placed on this planet to make our Creator proud of us</b>.\np: We are not making Him proud. We are only either getting butchered because we are disintegrated or we are murdering because we think violence is addictive.\nh3: Pause for a moment\np: Brothers and sisters, hold on for some moments. Just recall how long you lived. Moments passed and you turned from memory less to memory loaded scholars. An eternity of life crossed you and you are still struggling to bring in more stability. You have grown older, kids have become teenagers and brought a roof, a car and good meal on your table. Life has settled itself as you wanted it, 10 years ago. Yet you are struggling to accumulate more.\np: May be, the more we accumulate is how we further go away from the foundational goal of our life. As we run this marathon, we might never manage to stop and find fulfilment. If we do not pause now and think of making our life meaningful, our kids might not find the ‘<b class=lavendar>hero</b>’ in us, we want them to see.\np: Simply pause and waste your time<b> thinking</b>. Waste more time talking to your families and children. Waste more mornings on prayers and quite-ness. Let this time, <b>live</b> itself. Let your professions, <b>excel</b> themselves. Let the un-controlled, <b>stay</b> un-controlled. Do not try to block the abundance coming your way, <b>embrace</b> it. Make your children proud of you, by <b>falling</b> harder. Make your life a spiky graph of funs and boredoms. Live your life, like it is ‘<b>just a life</b>’.\nh3: #DelhiBurning\np: I have seen videos of #DelhiBurning on twitter. These are shockingly sad and heart wrecking. A man lying on floor getting beaten by mob is only too <b>chilling</b> to see. It is not why Allah has put us on this planet. It is not what makes Him proud of us. It only angers Him more and He will hurt us more. These people killing people is not why we were born. Not what our mothers wanted of us. Not at all what we wanted ourselves. <b class=lavendar>One act of impatience destroyed one city in one moment</b>. It has to stop. We need to Pause, re-think and re-do our lives. One city burnt is one million smiles faded. Each smile is worth millions. One moment of impatience ruined 100s of years of efforts.\np: May be, if we re-unite today we make it to mending broken fabrics. <b class=lavendar>We might start coloring burnt mosques and damaged temples back</b>. Some moments of patience might save us from losing these hard earned smiles.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Quran and Killing Non Muslims\np.note: This topic is inspired from yesterday’s tweet on Delhi Riots by Renee Lynn.\nimg: Delhitweet.png\np.caption.text-center: <a href=https://twitter.com/Voice_For_India/status/1233382577706237953 target=_blank> Link to the tweet</a>\np: Word <b class=lavendar>Non-Muslim</b> does not exist in Quran. Quran talks of bringing all the believers to success. Not only people of Quran will succeed, but all people who <b>believe</b> in Allah / God as one God and <b>maintain goodness</b> in their surroundings. According to Quran, Christians, Jews, Atheists or Hindus if believe in God, <b>they will go to Heaven</b>.\np: She is a famous journalist with large following. People acknowledge her promotions, even of violence. Her spark has more chances of burning cities than yours. She needs more attention than people burning streets in Delhi.\nH3: I am an atheist\np: I am also an atheist by nature. I do not believe in super natural and absurd agendas. I comprehend logic and believe in only what I see. I am reading Quran everyday. I am trying to connect these dots. In yesterday’s topic I read;\nquote: So for their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard. <span class=lavendar>They distort words from their [proper] usages</span> and <span class=lavendar>have forgotten a portion </span>of that of which they were reminded. And you will still observe deceit among them, except a few of them. But <span class=lavendar>pardon them and overlook [their misdeeds]<span>. Indeed, Allah loves the doers of good. <br> - Surah Al Maida verse 13\nh3: 3 parts of this verse\np: Above verse is broken into three parts\nP.b-left: <b class=lavendar>1. Fate of breaker of covenants.</b> People who break promises and spread lies, will find it more amusing and addictive. They will be lead to darkness. Their misdeeds will be made interesting for them. <b>Their success standing on the pillars of lies will only break if they spread peace. </b> Their hearts are <b class=lavendar>cursed</b>.\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>2. Definition of cursed people.</b> People who cherry pick portions of narratives, paint them with their own colors and spread them as truth are called as cursed people.\nP.b-left: <b class=lavendar>3. Pardon them and overlook their misdeeds.</b> Most importantly, do not be violent towards these people. Do not harm them. Do not hurt them. Do no attack them or their temples. Let them perform their misdeeds. Let them live their life in peace. If you attack them, you are not becoming closer to Allah. You will go further away from Allah into darkness and chaos.\nP: I doubt this verse has spread hate or false hope. It did not attack any non Muslim. It also did not create hatred. It united humans. It did not talk to a group of people.\nh3: Absurdly terrorising\np: <b>The terrorising factor is hidden underneath Quran’s agenda</b>. It will unite all people of goodness sooner than ever. Good people are people who find Allah with definite research.\np: Today it has become easier to carry out research and build opinions due to enhancements in the technology. After people find Allah with thorough research, these people will not stop and spare any darkness.\np: People who are war mongering beasts, might not find a place to fight people who have Allah beside them. As soon as goodness of Quran spreads, <b class=lavendar>it will dig fear deep into the hearts of its enemies</b>. The enemies of <b class=lavendar>goodness</b> and <b class=lavendar>peacefulness</b>.\np: Quran is bright, beautiful, pure and white. But as soon as you peel its skin, it is absurdly terrorising. It lets you die with love. It gives you patience of a flower sitting naked under the sun growing with humility all its life.\nh3: Conclusion\nP: Islam is not a religion of violence. Quran is not a book of hate. It does not have the word ‘Non Muslim’ in it. It has the word ‘Dis believer’. Dis believer is not a clan. It can be from a Muslim community to an Atheist community. Believer is also not a clan or tribe. It can be an Atheist, Hindu or Christian.\np: Stop putting people in boxes. Love them because this is how you will find a brighter world around you. Hating people and spreading violence has never met the peak you are striving to achieve. It does not bring people closer and create harmony. <b>Gandhi, Mandela, Churchill and Muhammad are all people who made this world better</b>. They are not wrong people, listen to them. Talk like them. Live like them. Rise like them.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Another day of success\nP.note: After getting inspired from @easyheal’s suggestion to reward myself with a gift after a day’s hardwork.\nimg: gloria.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: This is me rewarding myself 😀\nP: I am sitting in Gloria Jeans after a successful meetup event in Islamabad, thinking <b>it is easier to break if we misperceive our life</b>. Wrongly perceiving events takes us further down and it ruins our days. Life is good, but as soon as we label bad words with our experiences it becomes a miserable place to live.\np: Today we were successful due to 3 major reasons 👇\np.b-left: <b>1. Focused Audience.</b> Audience is always focused. But today we had lesser people and each person in our audience was thoroughly interacted and accounted for. We all discussed our problems to minute details and we found the motivation to rephrase our life. I am sure about mine. It gave me a bump to move faster.\np.b-left: <b>2. Discussed honestly.</b> This factor was missing in our previous meetups. Unlike last meetup we were crowded and did not find the time to speak our heart out. Some speakers managed to talk and some did not express themselves. It was a lot going on at stage and I was unable to match the pace of the event. Today, it was every one of us talking, participating and sharing our life stories.\np.b-left: <b>3. Went over the deadline by 90 minutes.</b> The event deadline was 1230 hrs. It was interesting enough to listen to each other. We managed to give a mix of demonstrations of fishing attacks to security vulnerabilities to using weaker passwords. It was alive even after the event was over. 🔥\nh3: Point\np: It was 7 people sitting in a hall having a capacity of 25 people. There was less noise, more serene, intense focus and directed effort towards a laid out agenda. Confidence was built. Assignments were shared. Quran was discussed. Preparation for Ramadan was reminded. It was not less people. It was more meaningful talk.\np: We break in our life, because we do not see the picture from all corners, shades and filters. Our picture of misery needs to be looked at again. It is misery from 1 angle. But there are more angles to reach a conclusion. Even if you have drawn conclusions, these are not final. These always have the room of improvement. Let others shape your conclusions. Let your ears listen to positivity. Let your welwishers work for you to shape your life.\nh3: Conclusion\np: I realised, we need less people with focused brain to bring a change. More people would only mean noise and meaning-less popularity. To ensure I bring the value to our Meetups, we will be trying to limit our audience to only people who will be willing to pay for the events.\np: We will be raising funds and talking in a cozy place to let our inner fears fade. We will do it together and we will filter the noise outside.\np.lavendar: Our next meetup will be at the same pace and same feel on 4 April at an undisclosed location. It has to be fun. Let us make a dedicated effort to filter the noise out and bring people to living in harmony to their words and actions.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Who is Allah really?\np.note: I was thinking today after sun set walking the metalled road and green trees with a close friend. Who is He?\nimg: road.jpg\np.caption.text-center: <a href= https://unsplash.com/photos/3Kv48NS4WUU target=_blank>Link to image</a>\np: Any artist when he creates something, he makes it from his heart. He cleans his vision and gives the perfect color combination he can think of. All good things designed in art, architecture and paintings, are images of somebody’s brain. The best images stand out because the artists could think of them. These paintings are reflection of somebody’s personality.\np: Before I try to explain who Allah is, let me explain how is He here in all His might.\nh3: Where is He?\np: Any movement of hand, leg, eye on the road I was walking in the evening was a miracle. None of this world makes sense. Some stones laid down, made up of <b>alive </b>organisms of molecules, building upto becoming stones and than staying halted on the raod to give it a grey texture. It is not possible. Earth is moving fast, heading in a direction unknown to anybody. Some days before, we said it is <b>static</b>. Than we said it is <b>revolving </b>around us. Now we are saying it is also travelling <b>linear</b>.\np: Everything is moving so fast, the winds to earth to these stones on the metalled road, that none of it makes sense. It is not possible to put life into any of it. All these things are made up of real moving magical molecules. The world is not modular. It is not linear. It is not defined.\np: In all this chaos of disorganisation and deformity, it is not possible to combine green of tree to blue of sky and put its image in my eye. All this is created by Allah. There is no explanation to it. In all this void, it is Allah who has given it a color.\nh3: He is here around us\np: One thing is clear. He is here. All around us. Encompassing us, our world and every aspect of our lives. Yet He does not talk to us. He does not come in front of us. The artist is not taking credit of any of His creation, He is up there, just out of our reach. The tip of our finger stretching out to reach Him, is missing Him every time. Can’t touch Him.\np: I am curious, what does He look like and who He really is?\nh3: He is beautiful\np: This abnormal, haphazard, disoriented world is of unmatched beauty. It is built on beautiful principles.\np: The neurons firing sensors inside our skin are beautiful under a microscope. The sun oozing out lava on a telescope is of un-matched beauty. The rays of light shining through our trees, spreading brightness on our faces is stunning. None of the disorientedness of this world, is visible in any of its view. It is of un-ending beauty. Any way we ruin it or we try to destroy it, the world does not lose its majesticness.\np: It is established. <b>He is beautiful</b>. The purity, serenity and shine of His face is amazing. He is going to meet us soon and we might lose our footings.\nh3: What is it like to be near Him?\np: On the day of judgement or at our death bed, He will be close to us. In heaven, He will watch us. He will let us walk up there and talk to His people. There will be roads, rivers, mountains, sky, grass and houses. Real bright people will be walking these places. We will be shaking hands with them. People will be discussing might of Allah. They will be truly living in calmness and serenity.\np: Heaven will be as good as our earth is. Only difference is, the roads will not end, rivers will not stop, rain will be kinder and clouds will be reachable. Things will be in abundance.\nh3: Conclusion\np: It is important we know our creator. He has all the feelings and emotions which we have. The more we make Him angry, the more in-trouble we are. He does not want to be ashamed of us. He wants us to love Him like He deserves to be loved. We need to rely on Him that he brings happiness and successes in our life. He has already put us in a magical world of impossibles. He has created the palace for us. We need to explore and find Him. He needs us to roam His planet and praise Him. There is no other logic of our creation. It is only to connect to Him. ",

        "body": "h1: Let us talk education in Pakistan\np.note: I am featuring my sister Rida Fatima from a remote village in Pakistan who talked about the flaws in our schools and universities at our <a href=https://www.meetup.com/techshek/ target=_blank>meetup on 1st March 2020</a> at Twinhub Islamabad. She talked about the reasons our students fail in life. What all things she learnt in her stay in New Zealand while attending UNITEC university of Auckland. She made us proud of her for being vocal, blunt and confident. I pray we have all sisters who talk like her and walk like her with their head held high.\nimg: classroompk.jpeg\np.caption.text-center: Slide of Rida’s presentation\np: As u look at this picture these are typical class rooms of our schools and universities; crowded, boring colors, boring subjects and faulty lights. Teachers do not feel comfortable talking to students. And students do not feel cozy to sit and interact with fellow students. All things that should not happen in a class room are happening in our class rooms. Our students are flooded with abundant information, they cramp it and immediately fall a pray to our education system; cramping books, competing for position, fighting to reach success by pulling someone else down. Our students end up becoming selfish, irritative and corrupted when they reach the position of value in a government office. Some become businessman and some become teachers. Same old fashion concept is scratched repeatedly on rotten boards thinking it will make Pakistan brighter.\nh3: A good class room\nimg: classroomnz.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: A class room in New zealand\np: This is a snippet from Rida’s presentation where she talked about how the classrooms in New Zealand are interactive and cozy with elaborate choice of bright colors. As you look deeper, you will find these classrooms are not very expensive to build. Neither is there any use of technologically advanced equipment. Only difference is, there is more use of paper hanging on the walls, setting of classroom and smile on students faces. Walls and furniture are bright colors of red, yellow and orange.\nh3: Cost Difference\np: Sister also presented the difference of cost in following two types of classrooms. It is surprising that the classroom built on the lines of a New Zealand settings is much cheaper to build. Cost estimate is below 👇\nimg: classroomcost.png\np.caption.text-center: A normal classroom of 40 x 20 ft size\np: According to the price <b>difference</b> the cost estimate of a hall size classroom in Pakistan reaches Rs 1 Million. <b class=lavendar>We are wasting Rs 1.0 Million on construction of 1 x class room in a good university in Pakistan.</b>\np: This cost can be used to place better computers on desks of same classrooms. This amount can also be used to build smaller to medium size universities in rural areas of the country. It can also be used to plan trips to Northern areas and arrange extra curricular activities. This amount is needed to bring smile on our faces rather than investing on costly ceilings, floor tiles and expensive furniture.\nh3: Conclusion\np: We only need to open up our minds. We need to embrace the modernism of Islam. We need to act upon Quran. We need to liberate ourselves from boring and dull culture of man-hood dominance where we are suppressing women’s freedom. We need to think like Muhammad and act like him.\np: Islam is not dull. It is a bright, open and vast style of life. Islam is not religion. Quran is not a religious book. Zakatlists is not a religious website. <b class=lavendar>It is all things colors, shining bright and living with a smile</b>. More love, more peace and more humility. None of what you are told is true. Allah is a great Creator. He made this world with bright colors. He does not want His people living a life of dull colors.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: The brightest book I have ever read\np.note: Have u seen anybody who manages to writes a blog every day? I haven’t.. I am not self praising. I literally haven’t seen anybody. Am I some genius out of this world?\np: No. I failed my <b>English</b> subject in school exams. I struggled with my married life. I have been to the bottom of my life these past few years. Relatives and siblings gave up on me. All down hill and then I came across the brightest book I have ever read in my life.\nh3: Awaken the giant within by Anthony Robbins\nimg.width-m-half: Awakenthegiantwithin.jpg\np.text-center.caption: <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Awaken-Giant-Within-Immediate-Emotional/dp/0671791540 target=_blank>Click here</a> to see book review\np: This is a very bright book. It gave my life some direction. Tiny bits were fixed. I managed to aggressively overcome my habit of smoking cigarettes along with feelings of un fulfillment. All bad things slowly and slowly got away from me. Life became golden. 😁\nh3: Next I came across Quran.\nimg.width-m-half: Quran.jpg\np: As I started reading it, it became boring. All same verses and no synchronisation. I gave up on it and resorted to gym, learning new skill on Udemy and loud music. All to ensure I stay motivated and do not give up. But again I stopped at staying consistent.\np: I did not find the solution even in Quran. The most religious but boring book.\nh3: What did I do next?\nimg: northern.png\np.text-center.caption: <a href=https://pakistantourntravel.com/tours/fairy-meadows-tour-package/ target=_blank>Fairy Meadows</a> in North Pakistan\np: I went to visit Northern Pakistan. Life became halted for 2 days. I really enjoyed the journey of North and all its beauty. But something was missing there. I failed to complete the picture because inside of me was still unfulfilled. A purpose to look upto and a meaning in all the beauty around me. It was incomplete while it was abundant.\nh3: Sword of Allah\nimg.width-m-half: swordofAllah.jpg\np.text-center.caption: <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Sword-Allah-Khalid-Al-Waleed-Campaigns/dp/8174355219/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=sword+of+Allah&qid=1583439864&s=books&sr=1-1 target=_blank>Click here</a> to find book on Amazon\np: I started with Sword of Allah by A I Akram. It jolted me inside out. Reading the colourful victories and bright emotions showed me light. I found calmness behind tears of brave fighters. The heroic people who rose to victories while dying with love. People gave the boring ‘death’ a color; red, orange, green, blue. They loved falling for their brothers and they fought like the lions of a fierce clan. People standing among enemies gave up, hugged them and followed them.\np: This book reflected on an image, I had never seen before. It was not dull, boring, absurd and illogical like Quran. Not even like what I have been taught in our mosques. Not even like all speaking truth, covering head and abusing infidels. It was modern, brighter and filled with chilling emotions.\nh3: I saw colors of Islam\np: I finally found <b class=lavendar>Islam is not boring</b>. It is not dull. Neither illogical nor all hatred. It is not at all what I had been thinking all my life. It is different, unique and amusing. It lifts people of good hearts irrespective of their affiliation to religion or a sect. It builds harmony in speech. It structures life. Gives purpose and makes the dullest words the brightest.\nh3: Winston Churchill\nimg.width-m-half: DarkestHour.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Cover of <a href=https://www.netflix.com/pk/title/80189214 target=_bank>Darkest Hour</a> Movie\np: Death for Winston Churchill has been shown colorful. He said before the battle of Dunkirk;\nquote: <b class=lavendar>Nations who go down fighting rise back up</b>. But nations who give up and surrender, live in slavery forever. <br> - Darkest Hour on Netflix\np: Death was lovely for people of Britain. Nazi was looming over them. Britains were willing to die to protect their home. Their leader stood at front. He honoured and loved his people.\np: This all love of sacrifice brought them out of chaos. Most fought the boldest fights and died. Britains roaring vanished Nazism. Today, the royalty and victory of United Kingdom is standing on bones and souls of these sacrifices. One fight has made them bigger, honourable and love-able.\nh3: Death is brightly mentioned in Quran\np: It is a story book. Braves fought and died. But they brought the nations out of misery and poverty. People who loved Death more than victory, created a dent in this world’s history. They were best in art, relationships, leadership and emotions. All good, childly and bright things were its followers’ reflection. Broad shoulders, shining teeth, tamed horses and beautiful speeches were these people’s hall mark.\nh3: Mosah, Haroon and Winston Churchill\np: When Mosah and Haroon asked their people to enter Jerusalem to win back the land of their fore fathers. They feared death and gave up. Two person among the people of Mosah  rose to take initiative. Just like Wiston Churchil asked his General to send boats to Dunkirk. But unlike army of Britain, army of Mosah gave up on him.\nquote: Two person said; \"Enter upon them through the gate, for when you have entered it, you will be predominant. <span class=lavendar>And upon Allah rely, if you should be believers</span>.\"\np: But they rejected the love of death. Failed and died in their beds. But the Britains who gave colors to death; lived and died with love. A smile, facing the sky and a battle cry, roaring till eternity.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Quran is not dull. Islam is not boring. Mosques are not places to do illogical rituals. These are libraries and laboratories to build science museums around them.\np: Please do not look towards people if you want to see the colors of Quran. Look towards Quran and its content. It is bright, colorful and lighter than a feather. It is a wave to swim in. It is a ride to feel the chills. It is a roller coaster of emotions, social values and life lessons.\np: <b>Muslims.</b> Please guys <b class=lavendar>draw, develop, write and paint</b>. If you are not doing it, you are not representing the book of Quran. Make life colorful that people look upto you and love your book.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: How to increase focus\np.note: Today it was fun. I tried to walk this path; <b>focus on less but useful. </b> We all are different. But these are some things that have made my life less crowded and less noisy. Read two tips👇\nimg.width-m-half: focus.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by Diego PH on Unsplash\np: I will try to highlight two aspects of our routine life. These aspects are happening unconsciously even when we are living the most productive day. I tried to curb on these habits and I am seeing amazing results. I am finding more time to give to my family, job and hobby. It is so amazing when you find abundant time to watch a good movie, read a good book and follow on a good habit. Life becomes fun and bright. Ok two things 👇\nh3: 1. Facebook vs Twitter\nimg.width-m-half: Facebook.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Everyday story of useless notifications\np: If you compete on the grounds of honesty, openness and easily finding amazing audience, Twitter is the obvious winner. It does not ask you for money to promote your posts. Only a small hashtag makes your content visible to thousands of people. These blogs are distributed on #100DaysOfCode hashtag. Hashtag is making it possible for me to easily market my product. Facebook however, daily takes more time to publish content and always asks me to promote it for around 5 USD = PKR 785.\np: It is alright, <b>asking money from your customers</b>. But asking everyday twice until you get fed up of this notification is <b class=lavendar>targeted harassment</b>. I do not want to see these notifications and I am unable to get rid of them.\np: I would say, use twitter to stay connected to your networks. And use it only for less than 30 minutes in your entire day. More of twitter is also bad on your mental health.\nh3: 2. Media vs Newspaper\nimg.width-m-half: marvikhalil.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Marvi Sarmad vs Khalil Ur Rehman\np: I did not know this happened until yesterday, 2 days late. I am so lucky I did not get dragged with the weird journalism of dragging people’s reputation. Two people fought like normal people fight and media has been punishing both of them for no sane reasons. These people have families and relatives to interact with. More abusive attitude of media and people around them is only going to affect their lives.\np: <b class=lavendar>Media is badly corrupted</b>. More people talking more insanely to be heard by even more insane world. It has to be cut out off your lives. It is only noise polluting your minds sub consciously. Resort to Newspapers.  Read one to two articles every morning with a hot cup of tea. It boosts focus and liberates of multitude of negativity.\nh3: Conclusion\np: If you are sincere with your life, you should start bringing in more focus by giving up on negativity and passimism. It is only <b class=lavendar>focus on one side </b>of our life, that makes us happier and contented. No body’s life is perfect. We all have difficulties. But people who can build an illusionary world of optimism around them, are winners. Protect this imaginary world with better lit walls. And sit inside it with a bright mind.\np: May be our worst enemy is abundant information on TV Channels and social media. May be it is useless to scroll on other people’s life on social media. May be it is too much to understand for us. May be sooner we turn off our TVs and Mobiles, sooner we will find focus and tools of productivity around us.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Prophet Muhammad was just a human being\np.note: For past 2 days, it is a fight with my own self. I am trying to convince myself, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was just another human. I am able to find some people of similar views who have hit me hard..\nimg.width-m-half: clouds.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href= https://unsplash.com/@wistomsin target=_blank>Tom Barrett</a> on Unsplash\np: Let’s take Quran and break its verse down 👇\nquote: The Messiah, son of Mary, was not <span class=lavendar>but a messenger</span>; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. <span class=lavendar>They both used to eat food</span>. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded. <br> - Surah Al Maida verse 75\np: Allah (swt) told about all the messengers; they all were human. Not super natural, super different and not angels. They were physical humans as good as we are. Same eyes, hair, legs and talks. All of them used to eat food. None of them could fly, avoid death and skip sufferings. Hardships came on each of them and they all managed to succeed.\nh3: Prophet = Human\np: It is really important to consider the Prophets a human. As soon as we consider them some people of super natural powers and super different responsibilities; we put their entire lifetime in a box and close it. Their life’s purpose becomes wasted. All the sufferings and prayers go in vain.\nh3: Can we get a place higher than a Prophet?\np: I once sent this question to Mufi Menk. He is a busy person so I couldn’t get an answer. But this thought crossed my mind back in 2018. <b>Is it possible that we become better than a prophet?</b>\np: According to verse above, yes. It is possible we cross prophets in goodness. We stand in Allah’s ranks ahead of Allah’s chosen messengers. If we strive to reach this place of reward and honor, the happiest person in this world will be our own Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). His life will get a meaning. His effort of proving to everybody around him of his Normalcy will bear fruits. Isa’s effort of telling everyone, he is just another human being will prove true. If we only consider these messengers humans, we will complete their massage.\np: To the people of Allah and his people, jealousy does not exist. They do not hate other believers crossing them in ranks of goodness. They do not find envy in people considering them normal humans. They take pride in knowing their fellows considering them not super humans but normal humans. They lived a normal life.\np: They were labelled “abnormal” by their enemies, “super humans” by their followers, \"extra genius\" by few and \"chosen ones\" by most. Giving them these labels only alienates our Prophets and brings down the meaning of their message.\nh3: Purpose of a Prophet's Life\np: All they wanted their entire lives to let people know they are just humans. They are exactly like us. They need same amount of sleep and same amount of love any of us need. They want us to look up-to them as humans and copy paste their lifestyle into our life.\np: Some say, they married more number of times. Some say, they were chosen to go up on Al-Miraj. Yes, they were chosen after they had a lifetime of struggle of proving their worth to Allah. If you prove your worth to Allah, Allah will take you to Al Miraj and such heights. He will take you closer just like all the Prophets and Messengers of Allah. If you struggle hard, it will only make these Prophets proud of you. Above all, the Allah will take pride in you.\nh3: Conclusion\np: In surah Baqarah verse 30 - 34, Allah mentions about the negation and opposition He faced when He decided to send Adam to earth.\np: He does not want <b>we let Him down</b>. He wants us to prove to all His opposition and negation, He is right. If we go blind and do not open our eyes, we are only making Him angry. He wants all of us to act better than messengers and Prophets. He wants us to consider His Prophets just like a normal human being that we work harder to get closer to Him.\np: This is not blasphemy, neither breaking the rule of Quran. It is the purpose of Prophet Muhammad's life. He wanted people to get closer to Allah with all our love. He did not want to be labelled super human or super intelligent. He lived a life of normalcy with more hardships than us. If we do not cross him in love of Allah, <b class=lavendar>we have no right to give him the leverage of being some one more capable than us</b>.\np: Give him credit for his hardships and struggles the least. Give him love and give him the label of a ‘normal’ human being which he kept on proving all his life.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Simple tip to creating content in Pakistan\np.note: Around here in Pakistan, we have boring office culture, boring routine and limited productivity. Companies are suffering and employees are not excelling. We need co working spaces where we can sit, talk and discuss ideas.\niframe: https://www.youtube.com/embed/IeEAlcGn4D4\np.text-center.caption: My favorite Mosque in Pakistan\np: I love designing, developing and creating content that is easier to digest. This is what we all content creators want; <b>simplistic perfection</b>. It needs quiet mind, better focus and little outside noise. We run to such places, sit and paint our thoughts. Sometimes it is an html web page and sometimes it is a sketch book. But the spaciousness and serene of a creator’s mind is priority one. Find one place that fulfils all these requirements and start doing what you love. 🔥\nh3: Coworking space\nimg: coworking.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Some place I would love to sit in and write blogs\np: All good companies create these places to let its employees feel fresh, passionate and energetic to be productive. Better employee returns better revenue. Better revenue means more freedom. Company can only reward its people and clients if it is generating revenue.\nh3: Problem in Pakistan\nimg: office.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Just another office in Pakistan\np: In here, around me in Pakistan, we have two professions; Engineers and Doctors. These two kind of people are made to sit in boring offices, given some amount of money to keep them in their offices and are often abused of their freedom and rights. They are not allowed to be passionate and energetic. Therefore, such spaces do not exist in our work spaces.\nh3: So.. Should we stop creating?\np: No. Do not stop creating. Do this 👇\np.b-left: 1. Learn 1 skill you want to be good at everyday. Give 30 to 40 minutes of your time towards this skill.\np.b-left: 2. Get skilled in 6 to 8 Months. You will find audience only after you have a skill that is polished everyday, consistently and shared with public.\np.b-left: 3. Find a boring thing in your life. Superimpose it with your interest. For example; I have created zakatlists to keep myself regular at university courses and reading Quran daily. These blogs are an implementation of superimposing my boring tasks with colorful interests.\np.b-left: 4. Start creating content and start sharing it with the same public who followed you along in your journey. They will support you and push you forward.\nh3: Where to create it\np: I am writing today’s blog sitting in above movie’s mosque on my mobile. It is zohr prayer. People are saying their prayers around me and it is all calmness. No noise stopping me. And no comments hurting me. It is only me with my mobile and my thoughts. I think there is no better place to write blogs than inside a mosque.\np: You should also take your laptop along and sit in a mosque of your village. Do not run to other cities with a worried heart. Do not find more coworking spaces. Just sit in your local mosque and further your polished skill. As you gain the skills, take all the freedom with you to travel to the remotest places on this planet. Freedom will come, but it asks you to polish your mind.\np: Pakistan is an amazing place with amazing people. We are little worried. May be your content will liberate us off our worries. So.. <b>start creating and stop worrying</b>.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Trust your steps. I am may be not very experienced and not very mature. But I am moving at a lightening speed to hit the sweet spot of victory. It is feeling great. Not because of all the successes but because of all the blessings in every day failures.<b> Some day it is a blog not getting good audience. Other days it is a meetup not getting good feedback. </b>In spite of major failures and set backs every month, life is calm, sweet and bright.\np: I will not ask you to write blogs. Neither I will ask you to learn to code and create websites. Because all these skills and habits are a by product of a focused life.\np: Three things 👇\nh3: <span class=lavendar>1. </span> Stop worrying about Tomorrow, Money and Kids\nimg: future.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@juvx target=_blank> Vlad Busuioc </a> on Unsplash\np: Give up on all these parts of your life. Do not try to control your future. Do not try to accumulate wealth. And do not decide your kids’ future. Give up on your plans. Stop thinking about tomorrow. Close this book. Place it in that highest shelf on your rack. Make it unreachable.\np: More thinking about future is equivalent of creating more doors to your life. You will need to keep an eye on each of these doors to make sure dullness, sadness and failures do not hit you down. Create lesser doors. One if possible. That is focused only on your own self. That tells you to improve you only. Asks you to be childish, selfless and not-worried. Block all other doors. Shut them down.

Do not consider yourself any lesser than Von Gough or Iqbal. You are more valueable, pricely and beautiful than all other people around you. Each step you take now, has more potential of creating dents than all great leaders in the history.\np: You have technology in your fingers’ reach. One word out of your hand has more reach than all the words combined until yesterday. One truth spoken today, will create more impact than all the truths till yesterday. You are valuable, beautiful and talented.\np: Create your new Normal. Take the initiative. Move boldly. Loudly. Confidently. Life is slipping each second. More time waste is hurting no one else but you, your self. Start creating. Stop criticizing. Start believing. Fear is temporary if it is tamed everyday. It is forever, if it is not tamed everyday.\nh3: <span class=lavendar>3. </span>Sleep More\nimg.width-half: sleep.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@thedakotacorbin target=_blank> Dakota Corbin </a>on Unsplash\np: Please take care of your sleep. 8 hours is best. 6 hours is minimum.

Fresh brain is your best friend. It will fix all of your life’s worries. You will feel better.\np.note: I was feeling quite dull 2 hours back. Now it is all fine and fresh. 1 hour of sleep has brought me back to life.\np: Sleep is the final step to achieving the highest place you dream of everyday. Not hardwork. Not timeless efforts.

Only sleep.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: balloons.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@artbyhybrid target=_blank> Hybrid </a>on Unsplash\np: Your life is pink, yellow, orange and red. It is not old neither dull. It is lively and colorful. Your 60 years of age doesn’t mean it went out of your hands. Your 20 years doesn’t mean, it is so long that you will bring in colors next year. These colors are for all of us. We all want to live a smiling, chilling and fun day. It is just that we think too much.\np: Stop thinking. Stop being logical. Stop being all wisdom and correct.

Just standing straight.\nh3: Self Check\nimg: begin.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@dsmacinnes target=_blank>Danielle MacInnes</a> on Unsplash\np: I had been a little confused passed one month. In the middle some shunning and thrashing. Some hurdles. Some criticism. All pointed at me. Asking me to stop. Stop writing, creating, walking and living. I failed at convincing everyone; <b class=lavendar>I can’t stop</b>. No body understood me; <b>I can’t give up on living a life exactly like Quran tells me to live</b>. I bent a lot. Tried to soften up like butter. But no body understood its butterly taste and color. Everyone had a problem with butter’s existence.\np: I thought Quran says to not be arrogant, angry and loud. I can’t even talk loud even if I am living according to Quran. I can’t even defend it boldly and bravely. It felt like my hands were tied and I am slowly and gradually moving to another pit hole.\nquote: No.\np: It is exactly, how I responded. I just said it. After days of logical discussion confusing me and everyone. I finally resorted to one line; <b class=lavendar>No! I will not stop writing blogs and I will not stop conducting monthly meetups</b>.\nh5: Believe me\np: My life has become so much easier since this day of <b>standing my ground</b>. Everyone who opposed me is now standing with me. Next to me. Patting me on my back and loving me for reading Quran and writing blogs.\nh5: I have realized\np: If I stand Firm, it follows.  <b class=lavendar>Life, fun, charisma and grace</b>. It follows you.\nh3: Who is “the Messanger” in Quran\nimg: mosque.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Abu Dhabi, by  <a href=https://unsplash.com/@farhan5792 target=_blank>Farhan Khan </a>on Unsplash\np: I will break this verse down 👇\nquote: And obey Allah and obey the <b class=lavendar>Messenger</b> and beware. And if you turn away - then <b class=lavendar>know that upon Our Messenger is only [the responsibility for] clear notification</b>. <br> - Surah Al Maida Verse 92\np: First reaction is “The Messenger” is the Prophet Muhammad PBUH. But it is wrong, awkward and mis-interpreted. <b class=lavendar>Massenger is </b>each one of us who reads Quran, acts on it and talks about it. Every one of us is responsible for carrying the message of Allah and spreading it to our friends, family and community.\np: If you are unable to do it. You find somebody who does it? Get closer to him. Befriend him. Support him. Get to a place where you also can read Quran yourself and talk about it. Once done. Be the “Messenger” Quran talks about.\np: Quran has been revealed on all of us. <b class=lavendar>We all are flag bearers of Islam</b>. We all are Mehdi, Iqbal, Abubakar and Muhammad.\nh3: Take responsibility for building your country\nimg.width-m-half: tweetpak.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Response to a Logo Request by <a href= https://twitter.com/digitalpak_gop/status/1237020391077490690?s=21 target=_blank>Tania</a> on digital Pakistan. Link to thread is <a href= https://twitter.com/archassociates/status/1237030717500141568?s=21  target=_blank>here</a>\np: Above is Pakistan’s response to a <b class=lavendar>positive step by Government of Pakistan</b>. They want to open a window for talented youth. They want to keep us in their circle of building #digitalPakistan. And we either label it too abnormal, too immature or too cheap. We do not want to listen and we do not want to clean a broken fabric without money. <b class=lavendar>I felt heart broken, damaged and lowly after reading this response</b>. More people encouraging this message is more hurting and painful.\nh5: How do you respond to these people?\np: Blunt, bold, offensive and breaking. Something that shakes these people to ground and re raises them from bottom up. Any one who will stand firm in front of these people, they will ridicule, discourage and offend him.\np: But the greatness is not, getting offended. It is fighting back. Standing firm. And talking truth louder. These small hearts are only irritated inside.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: roadpak.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@nazimlaghari target=_blank>Nazim Laghari</a> on Unsplash\np: <b class=lavendar>Pakistan </b>is just another country for you if you find it easier to litter around, spread hate and discredit its well-wishers. <b class=lavendar>It is only yours if you prove your love for it, shape it and make it colorful</b>. Find the broken fabrics and heal them. Live like a patriot who is willing to die for it. <b>Somebody who is willing to create for it. Not somebody who is <b class=lavendar>bought </b>to create for it</b>.\np: People who malign its image are only its enemies. People who malign truth are only truth’s enemies. Such people are weaker inside.<b> Give them the firmness and boldness they deserve</b>. This is the only way Quran ruled. This is the only way Pakistan will rule. in’sha’Allah.\np: ❤️\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

There is a continuous fear it will overrun us. What is the remedy..?\nimg: virus.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@cdc target=_blank>CDC </a>on Unsplash\np: I came out of my home. I am extra conscious of people who are sniffing, coughing or have flue. I am feeling all these people are corona virus infected. Trying to avoid a handshake or a routine salute. Too much precautions. Seriously, 10 minutes of this interaction, has made living miserable.\np: You need to do 3 things. 😁\nh3: 1. Burn down the masks\nimg.width-m-half: burn.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@mrrrk_smith target=_blank>John-Mark Smith </a> on Unsplash\np: Seriously. Burn these masks that are blocking your view. A life time of misery is worst than a day good spent. Skip this part where you are playing it safe. Trying to live longer. Just cheat it out. It is a viral infection it will find its way to your body if it is meant to be. A day in grave is going to be inside a grave. Precautions and rules are for people who want to live long dull lives.\nh3: 2. Live a normal day\nimg: goodday.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Pack up your bag and go places, photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@volkanolmez target=_blank>Volkan Olmez  </a>on Unsplash\np: Get out of this miserable lock down. Pack your bag with your DSLR. Tripod. Remote. And go out to a good place. Roads are already locked down. Lesser noise. Lesser smoke. Pictures will come handy. You might get the best shot with perfect balance. Get it. Edit it and share it. Name it “<b>Roads in a Corona Struck district</b>”.\np: May be not camera. Neither running nor cycling. Go out and walk. Enjoy the sun and smile. Notice birds. Clouds rolling and animals trodding our roads. The areas are open to wilderness and nature as they were some days back. Some years back when there were no roads, no discipline and it was all nature. Go out. Taste same old nature, we burnt down yesterday.\nh3: 3. Do not worry\nimg: laugh.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@benwhitephotography target=_blank>Ben White  </a>on Unsplash\np: Come back home. Watch netflix. Read a book. Have fun evening talks with your family. Laugh out loud. Go sleep smiling.\np: Corona should not hit your routine days. It should not burden your life. It is just a disease like all other diseases. <b class=lavendar>A healthy body, nurturing quality sleep is the best weapon against it</b>. Build a better defence mechanism that is natural. Fear ridden days and mask covered faces will block your view. It will slow you down.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: birds.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@mehdisepehri target=_blank>Mehdi Sepehri  </a>on Unsplash\np: Be careless, childish and free. Be a bird. Fly out of your nest empty pockets. Full of purpose. Travel north. Hit your goal. Sell your purpose. Get money. Find food. Travel home. Feed your children. Groom them. Make them your legacy. Be brave in front of them. Away from them. Let them look upto one version of you. <b>Be unified complete unit that is not shaky, fearful and sad</b>. Be a bright body that inspires them. Talk to your legacy. Let them clap for the food you brought home. Pat them to a good night sleep. Hug your family. Love them. And sleep like a worry less child. A worry less bird. Without a purpose and without a worry.\np: This world won’t stop at “<b>getting worried</b>”. They have to run banks, hospitals and economies. These are big people. Let them be worried. Let them fight these complicated viruses. You can only find a day, like this, today. Once it is fixed, the chaos, lengthy boring school lectures and tiresome work will all come back. <b>Till then; enjoy, sleep, eat and play</b>.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

He also spoke at our <a href=https://www.meetup.com/techshek/events/268858699/ target=_blank>event </a>on building self confidence. I will try to pen down his talk into words. It was an amazing presentation.\nimg.width-half: jawad.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Jawad Bhai ❤️\np: It starts with a blank mind. Nothing inside your head. No thoughts and no noise. All great things come to minds that are less crowded. That have lesser domestic issues and more love of something “<b class=lavendar>new</b>”. An empty mind is your friend. Clean it. Wash it. Make it sober and polite.\np: Let us make our minds and talks better today. <b>It is not to promote these blogs. Not to make this website work. Not to get fame. And not to get rich. It is none of this pollution. </b>It is only to build your mind that you stand in front of a crowd that looks at you with an awe. So that you make a difference in your circle.

But things he said are shown on his slides. He is a great leader who against all odds stood beside me to talk to few people who believe in us. These few people are very close to our hearts. We are here to support them in their struggles. We are going to lead each other to a bright future. <b class=lavendar>We ourselves are going to fix broken roads, damaged hearts and pride filled brains</b>. We will be standing strong and fighting strong.\np: <b class=lavendar>Join us</b>, if you want to build a brighter Pakistan. If you want to build a connected us. Join us. We need support. We need a pat. We need encouragement. We need love. Give us what we need. We are as human as all of you. Let us fix it for you. ❤️\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Later He gave us the example of Mosquito. Now He says, He gave us Life. Then he took it from us. Again He will give it and bring it in front of Him. He is showing Signs of His Power and His existance. One who fails to make an ayat, understand the complexity of this , one who can not believe in the seen. He can not believe in the un seen. First believing in what we see is necessary. We have seen a piece of meat coming to life (1st part of this ayat), but we have not seen a dead coming to life. People used to ask Prophet (PBUH), how can Allah (swt) bring dead to life. Allah responded, He can make a new life, why is it difficult for Him to make a dead bring back to life. Thus, it comes to this simple explaination.\nquote: Start believing in what is right in front of us. Understand the complexity of a mosquito, birth of a child. Understand basic might of Allah (swt) and He will guide us to make us believe in Un Seen.\nh3: Ayat 29\np: This earth is one of its kind. It can sustain life on it. It is still being researched. It is one project of Allah (swt). He says in this ayat, He then focused on construction of skies. He made 7 of them. I do not know how much is there up ahead and what He means exactly in terms of 7 Figure in Skies. I look above I only see stars and a Sun. But I know 1 thing, there is a huge universe above us. It is so enormous, I can't grasp its vastness. And if this sky is one of those 7 skies Allah (swt) is mentioning in this Ayat, then I am blind in knowledge. I have so little, it is nothing compared to what Allah (swt) has blessed these skies with. When I do not know the answers to the nature, not surrendering to Creator of this planet and the skies above is ignorant, illogical and stupid.\nh3: Ayat 30 - 34\nh3: Mukalma, Justification to creation of a human.\np: As in a gathering. Allah (swt) is sitting with Angels and Iblees (not yet declared Kafir). He declares\nh6: Allah (swt)\np.bg-light:  Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.\nh6: Angels reply:\np.bg-light: Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?\nh6: Allah (swt)\np.bg-light: (He teaches Adam (AS), who has already brought to life before the start of this conversation, and asks angels.) Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\nh6: Angels\np.bg-light: Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise.\nh6: Allah (swt)\np.bg-light: O Adam, inform them of their names.\nh6: Adam (as)\np.bg-light: Hazrat Adam (as) informs them of this knowledge given by Allah (swt) to him.\nh6: Allah (swt)\np.bg-light: Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed.\np: Allah (swt) has settled the argument. He declared, I know everything, even I just proved it to you. What I intend Adam (as) knows, and What I intend you Angels know. You possess only that knowledge. Thus He commands to His creation (Angels and Iblees) with wisdom of His own:-\np.bg-light: Prostrate before Adam\nh6: Iblees\np.bg-light: I can not. Sorry. I am better then this person. I do not believe in you any more. I can not follow you any more. I will prove you wrong.\nh6: Allah (swt) says\np.bg-light: He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.\np: I conclude this conversation with the understanding.\np.bold: If satan can go astray after years of submission. After coming directly across the Creator. After seeing the Angels and the Creator in his entirety. If still he can go astray. I do not know, how strong I am and where I stand. I can also go astray. May Allah (swt) keep us firm on this path, till we meet Him in person. Till we see Him on our death. Amen..",

You can read scholarly words <a href=https://www.englishtafsir.com/Quran/6/index.html target=_blank>here</a>.\np: Quran is the only creation that one can bank upon. Rest it is all variable. Nothing is in our control. We are vulnerable to our roots. One molecule missing its path to lungs will cause instant death. One spark of neuron will create joy. <b class=lavendar>If it had not been Quran, in year 622, Muslims would have surrendered</b>. They would have given up. Because, we humans are breakable and bendable. It was a bigger cause and purpose, that made our brothers and sisters back then, invincible.\np: Revelation of this Surah, was an affirmation to muslims.

Systematic.\np: Zakatlists is my name. Brothers in <b class=lavendar>Ramadanmakers, Facebook, Techshek, Twitter</b>, zakatlists is just a name.I do not want your money. Burn it. Destroy it. I want you all just get closer because you all are muslims. Just get closer and begin awkward discussions to connect. <b class=lavendar>Let us break our barrier of comfort and unite on Quran’s pillar</b>.\np: I am so annoyed. So angust. And so sad. <b class=lavendar>Prophet PBUH died</b>, almost. His followers died. They died <b class=lavendar>for us</b>. That we paint, write, speak on stage and defend Islam.

It is therefore important to understand <b class=lavendar>what is \"Beleiving”</b>. It is to <b class=lavendar>look at all the signs in this world of Allah, and submit to them</b>. Let me do it for you. Write down the signs of Allah:-\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>1</b>. A leaf of a tree is green. Find green. Define it. It might be red, but somebody in my childhood told me it is green, I started naming it green. For a cat it is black and white. Just to declare a leaf green, you need to define the mechanism of identifying green by a human’s retina. How it creates an image and transports it to brain. It can not be re created, neither can it be defined.\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>2</b>. The tree is planted on soil. Soil are particles. When it rains. It comes to life. When it doesn’t, it is just dead. Some particles giving birth to something that does not exist is magic for me. It is a miracle. It is a sign.\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>3</b>. A tree rises above ground. Sky showers water around. Particles give birth around. Mothers give daughters. Some are men some are women. In all chaos of evolution and movement, it is all peaceful and quite. Every second a fusion Atomic Bomb blasts on Sun ☀️ and it looks beautiful on every sun set and rise.\np: These are magical events happening around us. Do you believe in there being magical? If you believe in them, if you find serene in them, if you love them and if you find Allah in them you are a believer. If you can’t find time to find Allah in them, you are the person Allah talked about in above verse. <b class=lavendar>“They will ask for another chance”</b>.\nh3: Subject 2 👉 Self Check, Have I wronged\nimg: test.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters target=_blank>Glenn Carstens-Peters</a> on Unsplash\np: I write these blogs to connect <b class=lavendar>Quran with Science</b>.

I am not acting like Muhammad and Umar yet. They talked out loud to people to come into the circle of Islam. I am not talking out loud. I am acting sensible and logical.\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>2</b>. I am not staying truthful to my promises. I am breaking them. I am not calling some friends back after I told then I would call. I am telling a lie sometime. Imperfect.\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>3</b>. I am not being vocal yet. Not telling people to reach me out if they need help. I am not helping all of them. I am living an above middle class life. So many poor are dying of hunger and depression and I am not helping them. I think it is not my responsibility. It was Muhammad’s, but not mine.\np: I am not believing yet. <b class=lavendar>Not bringing the magic of Allah, in my equations</b>. I am not jumping into fire. I am afraid of million possible combinations that can go wrong, if I stand in a road corner and start calling people.\np: I am not fully believing yet.

We are not the skin and not the blood. We are something magical. A bigger might, a super powerful creature, that is both logical and beautiful. <b class=lavendar>If someone takes me out of this body, I will be a free person</b>. I, will be able to find things beyond <b class=lavendar>gravity, life and earth</b>. I will go up to meet others like me. I will visit places, I right now, can not grasp.\np: On death, it will be abundance of what we miss today. It will be <b class=lavendar>abundance of contentment, happiness and richness</b>. We will be closer to our creator, next to Him and all His subdued creations. We will be standing in the lines of witnessers of Allah’s might. Some angels, some prophets and some martyrs. We will be talking to them, looking at them, feeling them. It will be an ever lasting talk.\np: Guys, honestly, a beautiful day is coming. The next life is, more magical, more beautiful and more colorful. It is only at an arm’s reach. <b class=lavendar>Only after you die defending Allah and His Islam</b>.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

And come back home when Sun is up.\np: I am connected with our mosque. If I am told to give up on these gatherings, I would strongly advise we embrace the disease. <b class=lavendar>Anything that distances me from faith, is wrong</b>. This is definition of <b class=lavendar>fitna</b>; <b>wrongly linking Prophet's hadith to justify an act of division</b>.\np: Listen brothers and sisters. Give me your 5 minutes.

Reduces panic\nh3: Part 1 👉 Source of light\nimg: sun.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Sun by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@jakegivens target=_blank>Jake Givens</a>\np: We need light, a lot of it. While we are traveling down this road of endless facebook feeds and useless tiktok videos, we need an abundant influx of <b class=lavendar>white bright light</b>. Something that wakes us up. Shakes us up. Takes us higher. Moves us to grab it. Spread it. Lets us understand, there is more to this life. It is not empty and boring. It is yellow and orange. It is full of colors. <b class=lavendar>Mosques are this source of light to make our life colorful</b>.\np: Understand brothers and sisters, it is only in Quran. The source of all of our world and all of its biology, chemistry, physics. All of it is linked from above and beneath it with Quran. It is the <b class=lavendar>rope </b>Allah tells us to hold tight to. If there is no mosque, you won’t be able to stay true to your repentance. Believe me, it is not a vicious cycle of falling back to sinning. It is possible you stay firmly committed to your repentance. <b class=lavendar>Your life is held on the pillars of Mosque only if you are a frequent visitor of this place</b>.\np: I am writing this blog today in our mosque. I do not find my home and our library as soothing as this place. It needs an excessive amount of quietness to be productive. To shoot a good photo. And to write a good algorithm. I do it in mosque. Without it, I might fail at writing blogs and writing codes. It is my baseline. And <b class=lavendar>without my purpose, I am already dead</b>.\nh3: Part 2 👉 Reference in Islam\nimg.width-m-half: mirMak.jpeg\np.caption.text-center: Tweet by <a href= https://twitter.com/mirmakofficial/status/1238812800849494016?s=21 target=_blank>MirMAK</a>\np: These kind of fitna tweets and messages are circulating around us. I am not a mufti. Not a scholar. I am a muslim by logic. I am a web developer who is writing algorithms in his spare time to make this website work. I am not a liberal wasting time on twitter fighting satire agendas. I find God physical in front of me. Around me. I want to befriend God. Because I know He is right here. More these people talk bad about mosques, more they angry me. I get more irritated and more upset.\nh5.b-left: Logic 1 - Correct interpretation of Hadith👇\np.b-left: Prophet did not order this athan when there was calamity. He ordered it when there was rain and a storm. <b class=lavendar>1 odd day of excessive rain doesn’t mean you close mosque for an entire week</b> or month. Corona is not rain. It is a test. It is a disease. In this calamity you open your mosque. You pray. You ask for forgiveness in mass gatherings. Even if they bring you death and sufferings.\nh5.b-left: Logic 2 - The First Plaque of 639👇\np.b-left: The first plague that had hit muslims was in year 639. Abu Ubaida Bun Jarrah, one of the blessed ten, was governing Syria and its surroundings. He did not shut these mosques down. <b class=lavendar>He did not close gatherings where it was meant to get closer to Allah</b>. He rejected the invitation from Umar RA to revert to Madina, saying;\nimg.width-m-half: ubaida.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Snippet from <a href= https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ubaidah_ibn_al-Jarrah target=_blank> wikipedia</a> page\nh5.b-left: Logic 3 - Importance of Mosques in Quran👇\np.b-left: According to Quran\nquote.b-left: Only those shall maintain Allah's mosques, <b class=lavendar>who believe in Allah and Last Day</b>, and establish prayer and give zakat, and fear no one except Allah.

And believers are more logical, successful and liked human beings. They do not make absurd conclusions and spread fitnas. If a fitna comes to them, they prefer Quran over distance. Death over cure.\nh3: Part 3 👉 Reduces Panic\nimg: qadoos.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Sultan Qadoos Grand Mosque, Oman by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@mostafa_meraji target=_blank>mostafa meraji</a>\np: People moving on roads, going to mosques, coming back, 5 times a day is not only 5 prayers a day. Community runs on this lines. <b class=lavendar>People meet, discuss problems, release burden and find motivation</b>. Isolation is satan’s weapon. He attacks people who are alone. Takes them further away from their religion.\np: Due to corona, you might resort to pornography while sitting in locked down homes. In isolation, you might find more reasons to drink and commit evil than when you are a frequent attendee of mosques. Lack of good people around you, continous recitation and publicly committing yourself to 5 prayers, makes you vulnerable to evil. <b class=lavendar>Evil is greater than disease</b>. It is dangerous. It can lead to endless sufferings. Corona might lead you to death. But <b class=lavendar>after death, if you are a believer, honestly, it is fun, life and energy</b>.\np: Brothers and sisters, there is more to death. It is an abundance of happiness and love. Just try to embrace the decree of Allah as such. Do not distance yourself from Allah. He is your friend and welwisher. He wants good for you. He doesn’t want you to live longer. <b class=lavendar>He wants you die sooner in His way. In His love. In His mercy.</b>\nh3: Conclusion\nimg.width-m-half: doctor.jpeg\np.caption.text-center: Doctor by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@jcgellidon target=_blank>JC Gellidon</a>\np: With all the love and support for keeping your mosques open, comes responsibility. I know you are not afraid of death. But Islam doesn’t ask you to walk careless, act stupid and look immature. It is wisdom and love. <b class=lavendar>You wear a mask, a head gown and walk with precautions</b>. Act like you are a doctor, engineer and literate member of the society. You not only have to die in Allah’s way, but bring people into folds of Islam. Act in a way, people follow you, look upto you and find meaning in your call to mosques.\np: I am also tired of listening to half heard agendas and talks. I am writing this blog to let people know all of our speeches are incomplete. Just have patience. Do not end up judging your fellow brothers over half heard arguments. Listen to people of good hearts, agree with their disagreement and love them. <b class=lavendar>Having good heart is more goal achieved than a disagreed argument</b>.\np: Find peace, logic and love in your discussions. Do not fight. Do not hurt. Stay sober. <b class=lavendar>A muslim acts, walks and talks sober</b>. This is how, we muslims dominated the world. Dominate it once again. Conquer it once again. Make it colorful once again.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Superficial sentences like “<b>honest is best</b>”, “<b>I am best in the market</b>”, “<b>we are special customers/clients</b>”, do not have an impact. Make your sentences specific. Talk to the point. <b class=lavendar>Tell exactly how you are honest, what exactly makes you best and how you are special</b>.\np: In the wake of all this, I am going to tell you exactly “<b class=lavendar>how<b>” you can live a good day.

Is it time to go to school? No, remove this boring and difficult part. Keep lying there in bed. Did your mother come to wake you up? Act cute. And do not get out of bed. Just lay there. <b>Today, live a life to its fullest; sleep to your fullest, act childish, smile to the person who wakes you up, cuddle back, close your eyes and go back to sleep</b>.\np: Wake up when you are comfortable. It is a whole long day of fulfillment ahead of you. <b class=lavendar>Smile, shower, dress up the best way, put on your favorite perfume, open youtube, cook something and serve your family</b>.\np: It is a good habit to make breakfast yourself. Share your happiness.

Next is building a good hobby, making a goal to achieve and learning to write, paint or code.\np: Find a blank paper. Draw what you want to achieve. Put it in front. Paint all the cars, countries you want to travel and companies you want to go work. Put it all there in your blank empty vast white space. Fill it up. Make ugly drawings and sketches. Put all your life wantings inside this paper.\np: Go to <a href=https://www.udemy.com target=_blank class=lavendar><b>udemy.com</b></a>. Pick up a course. You need help? Don’t have credit card? Reach me. I will buy you one. (After you pay me 😀). And fix a deadline. 30 days, 60 days or 100 days. Commit to reaching towards your goal, 1 hour every day. Your personal space. No outside noise. Only you. Running towards your goal. For 1 hour everyday for next 100 days.\np: Spice it up 👉<b class=lavendar> Make it public</b>. Tell your friends you are going to follow this path of personal development.

Zero hours of boring life and safe play. All adventure and spreading love. You have already lived a good day. Now sit on Netflix. Cook pop corns. Watch all the movies you want. Just go lost in these movies. Forget there had been a life other than this. Throw all the pollution, criticism and negativity out the window. Let it rot in adventure less old boring days. Let it die in past. Let it no more hurt you and irritate you. It is your movie, your pop corn and your cosy sofa.\np: Sleep 🛏.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: motivation.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Motivation by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@clemono2 target=_blank>Clem Onojeghuo</a>\np: Live one good day.

        "body": "h1: Let us take responsibility to build a better Pakistan\np.note: It has become common to criticize others over their bad actions. Sometimes it is government in our limelight and other times it is some of our relatives. It is all happening because we are failing to identify our responsibility.\nimg: pakistan.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Pakistan by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@ahsan19 target=_blank>Ahsan S</a>.\np: I was going to share photo of Northern Pakistan. But that is only 20 % of us. Most in my circle, who have moved abroad, miss these roads and trees. The rickshaw and scooter. Light streaks beaming through trees. Horns on roads. Carts beside roads. People who were born here. Raised here. They miss this country more than all of their life. They are in Europe, Australia and USA. But have this faith, they all love Pakistan. They all want to come back. Build a home here. Raise their kids with their closed ones. Teach them meaning of being Pakistani.\np: If you are living in Pakistan. You are lucky. More lucky than someone driving Mercedes in USA. More lucky than people who have built excessive wealth. More lucky than all the other people, who are away from their homes. This matti (mud), it is a blessing. It is fuel to our lungs. It lets us live, smile, cheer and make loud noises on these curvy roads. It is desi and green. It is Pakistan.\np: شُكر الحمدُلله\np: We have a home, where we can live the life irrespective of what other states think of us. We can live according to Islam. We can give Athan. We can write Quran. We can preach the Prophet. We can defend him. And his Allah’s religion. All without any hurdles and obstacles. Just because, our mosques are open.\nh3: Fear and Uncertainty\nimg: lockdown.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Lockdown by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@joshrh19 target=_blank>Joshua Rawson-Harris</a>\np: Shops are getting closed. People are in self-quarantine. Fear is looming around us. Apocalypse is near. We all might die of this disease. There might be no future for our children. World is literally going down. Tomorrow, it is possible all of us get sick. In one month, if it is not controlled, it is possible world’s population reduces 50 %. It is an exponential graph. And fear of it overrunning us is justified.\np: In all this chaos, we are resorting to endless criticism. Un necessarily shaking the weakened morale. Not thinking, it is only creating more panic. Un necessarily sharing pictures of coffins in Italy and stats from BBC, is only spreading fear and panic. Government is not listening to you. Your points are valid. These are truly needed at this hour. But the forum of your talk; whatsapp status, tweet and post on facebook are not the platforms to share it. It is to act on the safety precautions and spreading all the goodness there is possible.\nh3: Act on it\nimg: happy.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Happy by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@phammi target=_blank>MI PHAM</a>\np: Do not talk about corona. Stop looking at it. Stop thinking about it. If you really care about fighting it, ignore it. Do not act stupid. Do not mingle with people. Do not get dirty. Do not take risks. But these are all the nots. There are numerous Dos that are directly linked with this virus.\np.b-left: 1. Talk loud with your family. It should be loudest. Happiest. And brightest. Mingle with your family because, none of you are infected. Your kids and wife needs you around them. Talk them out of this fear.\np.b-left: 2. Make an effort to raise funds for people around you. Like my brother, Huzaim, started today. He is planning to raise funds for people who are losing daily wages. You can <a href=https://www.facebook.com/feedthepoor786/ target=_blank>click here</a> to go to his facebook page to give him a little push. You can make your own facebook page, that is focused towards helping people in your community. Raise more funds that you spread more happiness.\np.b-left: 3. Make a corona dashboard if you can code. Deploy it around. Let people take you serious. Let them look upto you. Your talks and logics are correct. Only the platform is faulty. Raise the platform where your talks are heard and acted upon. Become an example. Write blog. Only <b>do </b>things to fight it. Instead of sharing death-ridden photos, share good messages of hope, light and energy.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg.width-m-half: vibes.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Vibes by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markadriane target=_blank>MARK ADRIANE</a>\np: Make a thumb rule. Talk about “good vibes only”. No boring, color less and dull critiques. Only useful, meaningful and love able talks. That lifts people’s day. That brings a smile to their face. That helps them fight this virus. That builds their immune system grow stronger.\np: Just like our Prime Minister said it, “This virus will spread”. Accept it. This virus will grow. More people will suffer from it. More deaths will come. It is a universal truth. Established fact. There is no running from it. Thus, it is just useless to talk about it. Talk fun, love and light. Talk nature. Talk humble. Talk. That people come near you and find courage in you.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Let us discuss importance of imagination.\np: It is an illusionary world already. We already think it is science controlling some part of our life. It is nature on other parts. We think we are in control. Yet we fail always, almost. Our kids fail. In spite of all the precautions we fall into an accident. In spite of all measures we get sick. Irrespective of the effort we put in to survive, we die. In an illusion, living all our life thinking we will become a legacy and turn the tides this time.\np: We already are illusionist. We think, we are in control and die one day living a life; victimised by this illusion.\np: It is important, we realise sooner, <b class=lavendar>we need to take control of our imaginations</b>. We need to beat this cloud of illusion that <b>we make our own cloud</b>, get it to shower on us, around us and <b>make our world green, fertile and rich as we think it should be</b>.

To make you feel the heat of how we used to fight battles. The love, taste and nakedness of Zarrar crushing through enemy lines, holding the corner of Yarmook across the bridge, standing in all its might and killing 70,000 Persians. How Ikrama stood his ground and disappeared with all his people. How Khalid broke the desert to reach Syria.\np: It is difficult. To tell you how Umar ruled. How he entered Jerusalem holding the rope of his servants ride. How Muhammad stood his ground ahead in Badr. How we ruled from emptiness of Mecca to vastness of Baghdad.\np: We were brave brothers and sisters. We loved death. We had this wanting to die in Allah’s path. We had been looking for excuses to simply put an end to this life of illusions.\np: We need to be brave once again, to fight Corona. <b class=lavendar>We need to love Allah, death, Quran and our Mosques if we really want to make our Allah proud of us</b>.\nh3: Affects 👉 Social impact\nimg: travel.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Travel by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@simonrae target=_blank>Simon Rae</a>\np: I am a muslim.

Because, otherwise, who can write blogs everyday for 81 days. Who can move and who can eat.\np: I know, <b class=lavendar>living a fearless life, will only impact us</b>. It will help us get out of our zone to reach out to people to help them. It will make us less superficial and less selfish. It will only make us caring towards our neighbors. It will keep the economy running. People will find courage in you and they will not rush to hospitals to choke them on minor symptoms. People will sit at home even after they find Corona inside them.\np: <b class=lavendar>If we fight corona, realising most of us will die fighting it, we will fight it better</b>.

Hang your small tent with it. Put in your laptop, a good internet connection and first aid kit. Make a “Raise Funds” page on facebook. Ask people for donations. Find people who need donations. Who need masks and clothes. Just go out and help them. We need more brave people out of our homes in this chaos and misery. Some people who are willing to die to help our ailing elders, fighting labours and helpless mothers.\np: Be brave. Talk your friends out of fear. Spread positivity. <b class=lavendar>Make others realise death was already coming, now it is only broadcasted live</b>. Same amount of people were dying of weather shifts, tsunamis and missiles. Now it is just that we are looking at it more often.\np: Close your eyes. Change this illusion. Love death. Live 1 day.

The green peaks, to snow covered mountains, to black oceans and white clouds. <b class=lavendar>All of it was made for our Nabi</b>. Allah is the best artist out there. This picture, written by Him is by far the best in all pictures. No movie ever can reach any closer to creation of Man kind, putting it on planet earth, bringing our Nabi and spread of Quran. It is by far the perfect, most beautiful and intensely emotional picture.\np: Let us watch this movie. <b class=lavendar>The movie of Allah</b>.\nh3: Chapter 1 👉 Life Before Muhammad\nimg: heaven.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Heaven by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@sam target=_blank>Sam Schooler</a>\np: It was all peaceful. Everyone was living in calmness. Iblees was prostrating around. Angels were busy in praise of Allah. Adam was in heaven. Life was perfectly fine. There was no confusion and no imbalance. All of it was created by Allah. The tip of our finger nail to the Sun. Its shine to its disappearance. The magic of winds blowing to crack of a crow. Mystical, musical and alive it was. There was no death. No sadness. No jealousy and no hatred. Before Muhammad, it did not exist.\nh3: Chapter 2 👉 Muhammad\nimg: wow.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Wow by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@adaliphoto target=_blank>Manuel Velasquez</a>\np: There entered the Prophet (PBUH).  A human that made Allah prove everyone wrong. Somebody who Allah loved in His entirety. Somebody made Allah proud of human being. Someone, who wont bend, break and bully. Who wont leave the hardened floor to pray, cry and lay. Someone who won’t talk loud, but the loudest will be heard. Who will rise like not Jibrael and Mikael. But Higher. Above. Far above to the Allah in this life. Who will be loved by all of Allah’s creations. Plants, angels, humans, jinns and Allah, all loved him. The love of whom made millions die victorious. Made million homes bright of love, grace and humility. Made poor, rich. Made death meaningful. Made Allah’s picture colorful.\nh3: Chapter 3 👉 Life After Muhammad\nimg: syria.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Syria by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@tkassis target=_blank>Timothy Kassis</a>\np: After the fan following, fame and success of Muhammad. The man kind lives fighting each other. Proving each other’s wrong. And reach some days later to death; the next chapter in Allah’s picture.\np: Some angels, some jinns doubted our Allah. They thought we will shed blood, hurt people and destroy the planet. Some thought decision of Allah to bring the mankind to Earth is wrong. To make us His representative is wrong. To bring Muhammad here and make him conqueror of Ibrahim’s city is wrong. Some thought. Some betrayed.\np: This next chapter, the last chapter of the movie, is the climax. People standing in lands of Arafat, Muhammad standing ahead, creations standing and Hell roaring. This climax is the most awaited ending for all the believers. All the doubts, negations and pride will submit. Finally the King will rule, in all His might and power. He will make one message conveyed; it is All Allah’s. All of it. He will prove the creations; milky way to sperm in womb, is all His.\np: Find it dreadful, threatening and dangerous. Some years ahead, 10 may be, it is death. Right after death it is the climax. Right after climax, it is Allah the most beautiful of all, the biggest and highest of all, the most love-able of all.\nh3: The end\nimg.width-m-half: run.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Run by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@r3dmax target=_blank>Jonatan Pie</a>\np: This ending is unique, detailed and different. It does not end. It goes on. Some day you will sit with Muhammad. And some day it will be Ali sitting beside you. Some day Khadijah will invite your family for dinner. Some day Jibrael will talk to you. Some day Allah will recite Yasin. Some day it is Adam and some day it is you in your Prophet’s kingdom.\np: This is the reason I love Prophet. I can’t wait to meet Allah. I can’t wait to meet Jibrael and Adam. I have been told by Allah, this world is a hoax. And I know after this world, it is not a fraud, not a hoax and not an end.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: 3 x reasons you should learn to code\np.note: I am writing code, morning, evening, any time I get off my busy routine. That says, I love coding. Let’s discuss, the fruits it bears and the successes it brings.\nimg: code.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Code by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@clemhlrdt target=_blank> Clément H</a>\np: It was tough to fix a broken program. Back in days of no code, the alert sound in my computer made me think, everything has gone bad. It never worked, the fix. All the efforts put in to make computer come back up, were in vain. How did I manage to live back then. I hardly felt the buzz in these old days. Mostly I was not productive and used to waste my time watching movies and listening songs. Now it is a mix of everything. Movies, eatings and codings.\np: Ok, the topic is 3 things. Let's read them. Put a smile on your face for good things are coming up next. 👇\nh3: <b class=lavendar>1.</b>Builds analytical thinking\nimg: brain.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Brain by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@lunarts target=_blank> Volodymyr Hryshchenko</a>\np: Analytical means, able to think in chains. If one thing happens, it leads to next and continues till it is completed. It means, you are given a problem, you now have more ways to look at it. You can weigh out which solution works faster, quicker and sooner. Ok, it works. The solution you build after writing codes for 2 years works. Not only solutions in your computer. But everything from grocery shopping to selection of words in your sentences. It has an impact on your life and boosts your confidence.\np: See, everything that involves putting effort on your mind, has an impact. It somehow boosts your health. It builds your immune system. It lets you walk with grace. It puts a smile on your face.\nh3: <b class=lavendar>2.</b> Work Solo in lockdown\nimg: hoffice.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Home office by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@jackychiu target=_blank> Jacky Chiu</a>\np: Lockdown, stuck at home, can’t walk around. These things are dulling you down. You are a social animal. You are not given ideas, thoughts and voices, you go down this lane of depression and misery. You need to come out of this prison yourself. You need to fight to find a way to stand back up on your feet. You need to live back. Get this lost ego back. Get that childhood back. Else this panic spread by cowards will kill you. It will bring you to your knees. You are my bro, not strong. You are not able to handle these cowards panic. You my bro, need to get out of this panic right now. Do not stay in this valley of loneliness any longer. Get out of it. Fight it. Live it. Else you will lose the colors and light you worked so hard to find.\np: Buy a course right now on udemy.com to learn to code. Work on getting back your life fully solo. Do not depend on others. These people they can not bring you happiness and life. You, yourself has to to bring it back.\np: If you ask me, <b class=lavendar>coding is by far the best platform to build a fully dynamic, complete in itself and really rich life</b>. It will let you make next google or next facebook. It will let you create a country while corona is killing, people are hunting and life is shutting. The country, that will be richer in itself. It will let you live that life; rich, happy and solo.\nh3: <b class=lavendar>3.</b> Travel the world\nimg: travel2.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Travel by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@jeshoots target=_blank>JESHOOTS</a>\np: Don’t say you don’t want to travel. You don’t want to live a month in Switzerland and 3 months in USA. You don’t want to go to Mecca, spend some nights in Pullman and ride some horses in Africa. You don’t want to see kangroos and you don’t want to sea dive in Thailand. Don’t say it.\np: You want to travel. It is in your blood. You live hoping you will go places, you will shoot photos and you will create memories. You want it and honestly, you deserve to have it.\np: Walk this road of <a href=https://freecodecamp.org target=_blank>Free Code Camp</a> and <a href=https://getmakerlog.com target=_blank>Maker Log</a> where people who are exactly like you, same brains and same abilities, are building brands everyday. Walk this road of coding, where people are picking #100DaysOfCode challenges on twitter. Walk this road of html, javascript and python. Bro, you will thank me in 2 years. If you follow this road, you will love me. For once you are traveling the world, you wont look back and you wont stop.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: goal.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Goal by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@esteejanssens target=_blank> Estée Janssens</a>\np: I felt down yesterday. I thought corona had hit me. I sat back, faded and almost fell. But at this moment, I found myself open to an amazing world of endless coding and blogging. I found myself wanting to just sit at home and live my life behind closed doors forever. Only, because I can code, design and launch, I wanted to embrace the shut of nature. It was overwhelming, the contentment and peacefulness of being able to “Do” even when the world was closing in on me.\np: I did not stop. I still woke up early in the morning. I still felt excited. I still found endless possibilities ahead in my day. I still fixed myself to this train of life. Rode it to work hard the entire day. And now, sitting here, thinking, it is fun. Life is fun, when you can code. When you can work solo. And when you can live with locked markets, mosques and libraries. Life is fun.\np: Do not miss out on the opportunities, this world has to offer you. Do not look at newspaper, tv and panic feeds on social media. Do not over burden yourself with matters of state. It will come, death, as it is destined. Meanwhile, try to live, love and laugh. This life is \"<b class=lavendar>once</b>\" at your doors, you do not know tomorrow. Make today your best investment of your life. Make it the U turn you have been planning to take for so many days. Make it the step, you know, will take you towards your goals. Make it today, for all the glories and victories comes only once you take this step of moving, running and jumping towards your goal.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Community Owner’s Responsibilities\np.note: If you are a community owner / head read these guidelines. It will help you win confidence of your people and will help you make your community reach “<b class=lavendar>level 5</b>” of leadership.\nimg.width-m-half: level5.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Snippet from <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Leadership-Proven-Maximize-Potential/dp/1599953633 target=_blank>The 5 Levels of Leadership</a>\np: Leadership is different steps of becoming a good human. All of us are leaders at some part of our life. At times we are leader of our home, at times at our job and at times some revolutionist trying to bring a change. It is an important trait. It is needed to be learnt to live a meaningful life.\np: This topic focuses on three major things to make your community a success, where you act at level 5 called as <b class=lavendar>Pinnacle </b>of leadership. (as highlighted in above photo).\nh3: <b class=lavendar>1.</b>You are available to help\nimg: help.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Help by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@emotional_discord target=_blank>J W</a>\np: It does not tire you, helping your community members. You hide a world of despair behind a bright face. You respond, call and listen. You talk less and lift your members. You consider your members, unique and important. Each member, a gold, platinum or silver, is equally respected by you. You do not look at the successes and achievements of your members, but you look at their sincerity. If you find some broken fabrics, you take responsibility to heal them. Some people who lack confidence, you build them. Some who fall behind in finances, you fund them. Some take the step, the jump, towards their goal, you market them. You do not get tired, upset and angry. When they reach you for help, you do not shut them. You put yourself always forward, available.\np: If you think, it will overburden you and tire you down. You have not yet reached the Pinnacle of leadership. You do not have enough love for your people. You do not, yet, fully believe in yourself.\nh3: <b class=lavendar>2. </b>You do not make money off your people\nimg: simple.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Simple by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@benchaccounting target=_blank>Bench Accounting</a>\np: You do not make money off your community. Because you do not need it. You can not lead your community, if you are in greed or you are in want of money. The ingress of money and wealth, corrupts your mission. Your community, is not built to make you rich. It is built to talk, help and get rich together.\np: Money and rich life, is a by product of becoming a good leader. As you walk this road of selflessness to lift your people, you realise, money only pollutes your goal. It puts dirt on your mission. It drags you down. As soon as you start hating money, it tries to come towards you more. It over takes you. But you need to make sure you keep your doors <b>shut </b>to money and <b>open </b>to people selflessly.\nh3: Everyday you set a new Example\nimg: training.png\np.text-center.caption: Training by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@firmbee target=_blank> William Iven</a>\np: You lead people by example. Your examples do not get boring and dull. Everyday you take a time out of your busy routine to do one leader-ly step. Everyday you create one meaningful product that puts a smile on your people. You need to prove your mettle.\np: <b class=lavendar>It takes tremendous amount of hardwork to be able to create examples</b>. At times it takes an hour off your morning snacks or an hour off your night sittings with your family. It takes dedication, focus and sincerity to be able to deliver your promises. Without putting in this hard work, you can not reach the pinnacle of leadership. Without it you can not build a community full of colors and values. Without it, you lack some purpose. If you are not dreaming of reaching the pinnacle, you are failing at answering the questions. Some questions that are hitting you down, stopping you from taking risks and keeping you from living a life full of freedom, air and colors.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: blog.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Blog by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@patrickian4 target=_blank>Patrick Fore</a>\np: I will conclude by telling you \"<b class=lavendar>how I wrote this blog</b>\". I started designing its skeleton at night after isha prayer in our mosque. Wrote its preface and description after fajar. This conclusion, I am writing sitting here on road in my car, looking at the green trees, feeling the cold air and hearing the birds chirp. I am trying to make you understand, <b class=lavendar>it is not philosophy neither Doctorate, that fixes your life</b>. It is not what these news journalists, your neighbors or your society is telling you. It is none of that old dull pile of books, that makes your life colorful.\np: It is only “<b class=lavendar>actions</b>”, on your self created rules. Try not breaking them for once. Try to stick to them. You deviate after few punches. You give up on all the initiatives you take. All the dreams you have seen. You just give up sooner or later.\np: Success comes only after you walk this courageous path of not bending your own rules. Where you do not mold your talks, speeches and reactions. It comes when you become one bright picture. You speak truth, stay humble and be available. All that said, it is; Only after, <b class=lavendar>you become like Muhammad, you will reach the pinnacle of leadership</b>. Because, who ruled, lead and conquered this world better than Muhammad.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Will google work better or a remote factory in Egypt.\nimg: elephants.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Elephants by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: I know, I will be wrong. Because I am assuming things will go this way. After looking at some blog posts, some tv channels and some panic-buying by people, I am thinking of a different future.\np: Today’s topic is broken down into four segments. <b class=lavendar>1.</b> How riches are affecting poor. <b class=lavendar>2.</b> Its affects on our planet.<b class=lavendar>3. </b>What bigger is possible. And <b class=lavendar>4.</b> Finally the winners.\nh3: 1. Poor happy, rich Miserable\nimg: happyasia.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Happy Asia by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@flickr target=_blank>Flickr</a>\np: You are already seeing WhatsApp feeds of people playing cricket with policemen beside the road, next to the petrol car, next to the authorities. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGYI9GnSBG8 target=_blank>Click here</a> if you haven’t.\np: You must have seen people who need food and are standing in lines to collect it in areas of lockdown (Gujranwala, Pakistan). <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fuc36GKNx4 target=_blank>Click here</a> to see.\np: You have also seen people in Gaza sitting in gatherings praying for more of Allah’s mercy. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pUnzaZKA2s target=_blank>Click here</a> to see.\np: These are some examples of poverty struck people. They do not have information needed to take safety measures. They are vehemently ignoring guidelines and precautions against Corona. They did not find time and money to empty shelves in their shopping marts when riches were buying. And they are not seeing a life as quite and as bomb-less as today. <b class=lavendar>They are happy for the riches are busy fighting their fear, taking their measure and looking after their families</b>. Today the poor are not suffering. Now they are neither taunted nor snubbed. Now they will live better, work tirelessly without fear, feed and build a better home for themselves.\np: There are chances, the weakest states will rise after this calamity. Shortage of manpower and requirements of volunteers abroad, will make these poor people valuable. Factories in poor countries will flourish. <b class=lavendar>The hard working people carrying rocks today, will build masks for the world tomorrow</b>. With their courage and bravery, they will fight Corona, misery and poverty around the globe in all its honesty. They will spread happiness, morals and values of a hardened fighter.\nh3: 2. Planet 🌎 will breathe again\nimg: earth.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Earth by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@scottwebb target=_blank>Scott Webb</a>\np: You know its meaning already. Let’s gaze at it. Our planet is made up of all natural ingredients. Animals, sand, water and birds. These are not scientific creatures, these are magical. These creatures just exist there. No one knows who placed them here. Some say it is evolution, some say it is Allah and some say it is just nature. But honestly, no body knows what it is.\np: After the corona and deaths,<b class=lavendar> the world will have a new start</b>. These magical creatures will still be there. All of them. The fungus on roads to uncut growth on roof tops. The lions in our dining rooms to elephants in wineries. It will become a different world. A world that will be purely natural. Where all the magical world, will live happy once again. No human will stop them, no human will judge them and all of them will be looking up thanking this creator. The creator who made us and all of them.\np: May be it is my Allah, or yours nature, but we all sane people who find these creatures magical, already have labelled it. We give it a name. We go on believing the name bearer is beautiful, magical and mystical. <b class=lavendar>It is true, the real magical world is only magical, because humans did not have a hand in it</b>. Else it would have been no more nature, no more air and no snow glacier. It would have been a mesh of  metalled roads, sky high towers and loud hooters.\np: The planet is already breathing. Air is already healing. Life is coming back to normal. No more slogans of ‘<b>Save the planet</b>’. No more warnings of ‘<b>Melting glacier</b>’. No gatherings of ‘<b>Climate Change</b>’ to raise awareness. Planet is doing it all by itself. <b class=lavendar>While the world is sitting in fear, the planet is once again coming back to life</b>.\nh3: 3. A united Islam\nimg: peace2.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Peace by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@jmeyer1220 target=_blank>Jonathen Meyer</a>\np: <b class=lavendar>Islam</b>, I want, is name of a flag. That represents only people who love this planet <b class=lavendar>breathing</b>. The name who wants this people <b class=lavendar>living</b>. Some religion that wants us <b class=lavendar>connecting</b>. A flag that brings us to <b class=lavendar>loving</b>.\np: It will happen. As people kneel down and submit to the micro power. People will find meaning in creating once again. They will start riding horses once again. They will start talking again. People, will unite again.\np: Islam is not vengeance and blood. It is love. It will protect you to take you near to your self-fulfilment. It will bring discipline to your life. It will protect your words and will make your sentences colorful. It has made me able body, fully jolly while on stage.\np: With such people, who have purified their immune systems and have grown stronger anti bodies, we will find more honest and humble people nearing Islam. It accepts all religious books, and honours all the Prophets. It is just that <b>people do not yet know its meaning</b>. With Corona, people are now finding time to find the real meaning of life. It brings people closer to Islam.\np: After the calamity is done, we will have a peaceful world of justice served. <b class=lavendar>It will be all peace. It will be all Islam.</b>\nh3: 4. Flag of Islam\nimg: cloth.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Cloth by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@kaboompics target=_blank>Kaboompics</a>\np: Islam will be one single flag. From Indonesia to Spain, it will be a place of great artefacts, just society and balanced banking system. People will find trade in coins of gold and dates of palm; the currencies of intrinsic value. No one will bomb Yemen, damage Syria or snub Kashmir. More Iqbals, Salah ud din Ayubis, Haruns and Abu Ubaidas will come. Some people of faith in Allah, will lead us. They will bring us higher, literally, closer to Allah. We will die for them. We will stand like an “<b>un break able wall</b>” to Corona. They will be young people, riding their bikes, holding their tents on back, driving North. These 20s to 30s will make you love them for their selflessness. They will hunt Corona and crush it. They will snub it and bring health to people. They will knock at doors, hand over cures and knock the next door. Some of them will die young. But they will make us, One.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: positivity.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Positivity by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@polina-zimmerman target=_blank>Polina Zimmerman</a>\np: This calamity is a mercy for believers. Because Prophet PBUH said;\nquote: Plague was a Punishment sent by Allah on whom he wished, and <b class=lavendar>Allah made it a source of mercy for the believers</b>, for if one in the time of an epidemic plague stays in his country patiently hoping for Allah's Reward and believing that nothing will befall him except what Allah has written for him, he will get the reward of a martyr. <br> - Sahih al-Bukhari 3474\np: It will unite us, because merciful events brings attraction and goodness. If we are hit hard with such calamities every now and then, we will become stronger to unite and difficult to divide. Some muslims will join the lines of riches and some riches will join the lines of muslims. Some filters and sorting will bring only the believers forward. Some group of people will conquer the world. Some 313 and some burning of boats. Some Jerusalem and some Ottoman. We will revive some memories of our successors. We will re live the battles of Badr, Khandak and Yarmok. We might go into a Hind. We might go into the Spain. Who knows, this world gets rid of the pollution. This world gets rid of the misery. It shudders its shoulders to bring back the colors it lost. Who knows, we find next Google in Egypt, or find next Eiffel Tower in Syria.\np: The world ahead is fixing itself. It is healing us. It is connecting us to our creator and bringing us back to the nature. We are getting cured. Some exponential graphs and red boxes are seggregating the pure from the impure. Some volunteer doctors are running and some coward riches are hiding. Some brave drivers are transporting and some horror struck are stoping. Some are playing cricket in streets and some are shouting death in their critics. Some wants to break the country and some want to die for their country.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Come on, let’s lift our mood together.\nimg: lights.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Lights by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: I want to carry the buzz almost always. Not one second, I want, I get down. It hurts productivity and routine. I put my phone on airplane mode to make sure it doesn’t send me another Corona news. Switch off my tv that it doesn’t show angry people. Walk the road every other hour to feel the air. All to make sure, I do not go down this road of no-productivity and dullness-ness.\np: Three things, I do, to come back alive. 💥\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>1.</b> Control the flow\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>2.</b> Bombard with positive information\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>3.</b> Become Vocal\nh3: 1 👉 Control the flow\nimg: thoughts.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Thoughts by  <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@bintimalu target=_blank>Binti Malu</a>\np: If you focus closely on your mind, you realise your mind is in a continuous cycle of processing information. It is emitting sparks of energy that carries the message down to your nurons. Some body part makes a decision and the cycle goes on. The brain, these sparks and the limbs do not stop processing. And at the beginning of all the actions you do, there is always one spark. It resides there at the first stage of all your actions.\np: The first important step towards bringing you back to positivity, is controlling the first spark. If you miss it you miss out almost all the fun. Right now, you can not control these sparks but with dedication, honest intention and belief in yourself, you can.\np: Give it a try for 1 month. Every time you find yourself hitting the dead end of your life, stop there and rewind the whole movie of actions, to messages and thoughts which lead you to this dead end. What was the first thought that crossed your mind.\np: You will find, the first thought is a mere broken and loosely knitted message, which you got carried away thinking it is nothing. No it will not harm me. It is just a small puff of cigarette in a month, it is just another song or it is just another hour before you get out of your bed. Small bad decisions leading to big bad actions.\np: The life of ours, is encompassed with such small atomic habits. Not big and bold decisions. But tiny decisions. Reaching 5 minutes before all commitments, 10 minutes listing tomorrow todos before sleeping, deciding to dial the number to your long old distant buddy you missed to talk to before, and taking small vulnerable risks to boost your adrenaline. These tiny habits, and tiny decisions, create a chain of events. These lead you to a positive mind. Healthy where you control your thoughts. And your thoughts do not control you.\nh3: 2 👉 Bombard yourself with positive information\nimg: mirror.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Mirror by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@mayur-rawte target=_blank>Mayur Rawte</a>\np: Look at yourself in the mirror. Find the hat in your mind, you want to wear. Draw the coat you want to take on. Dim out the background. Put your best places you visited behind you. Change this “background” every second. “Nai”, “yeah this one”, “nah not this one”. Select some. Deselect some. Find the best background you want behind you. Now it is you, suited, booted, standing in the peaks of your career. Standing in the highs of your life. Now you have bombarded yourself with mega tons of positive information.\np: It will bring you back to stage one of the mind control game. You have now mastered it a little more. Now you have put a toll on your brain to boost its metabolism.\np: On these lines, every day for 5 minutes, draw your favorite picture by bombarding your brain with million possibilities. You will have trained your brain to think positive bright games. These games are the real play, which will change your life’s play. You will embrace it, in 3 days. In one month, you would have moved 100 steps closer to your goal. This way, you will reach your dream and your goal, sooner than you think.\nh3: 3 👉 Now become Vocal\nimg: voice.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Voice by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pressmaster target=_blank> Pressmaster · Photography </a>\np: The best and by far, the most amazing marketing tool is your tongue. It lifts people. And this same tongue, destroys people. Moving tongues run Parliaments. Static tongues work for Parliaments. If you want to lead, you need to talk. You need to be vocal. Straight to the point. You need to tell people, exactly what you mean. Not what you don’t want to mean.\np: No amount of justifications and lengthy actions supplement the power of being vocal. It makes you look brave, clear and precise. It lets you take control of your life. You do not want to speak for anybody else. You need to speak for your self.\np: Take a 30 minute time off your day where you just make calls. You just talk nonsense. You just get embarrassed. But don’t give up on your priority list of people that you are going to call in these 30 minutes. If you know, and if you believe, you have everything there is needed to bring back you to your foot. You have all the brain, all the ability and all the potential, needed to live your life. You do not need anything else. What you have is enough. All you have to do is, wake up. Because this life is going to shut, if you do not go up.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: light.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Light by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pressmaster target=_blank>Pressmaster · Photography</a>\np: I lost somebody, more dearer to me than anybody else in this world. I loved him the most. I broke apart. I tried to find courage and call. Some siblings, some relatives and some friends. But I realised, it is all me, inside. No one else will take me out. No one else will bring me back. No one in the entire world will bring me back to writing this blog. But me. No call, no tears and no support. But me.\np: I am writing it. And I am honestly, happy. The legacy this person left behind. They way he stood for the kind. I have to continue doing it. If I do not come back now, who will live his legacy. Who will meet him with pride. Who will go and help his bride. This is my phupo. She is sad today. She fought hard for people and got tired today. I find it hard. I find it dark. But who will get back up on his feet and fight. If not me, who will live and spread light.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

There is no sound of engine. Clouds are beside me. It is empty. No passengers. We are heading towards the old New York and Norway. No signals. No messages. Because out of 24 hours, 16 hours my phone is on airplane mode.\np: ok beat this.\nh3: Which is your favourite movie?\nimg: movies2.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Movies by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixa Boy</a>\np: My favourite is one with fiction and love. To name few; Adjustment Bureau, Upside Down, Book of Eli. No normal movie. I love people running to save their lives. And two stupid people are in love. Some doctors saving lives. And two persons are planning their marriage. The world is collapsing. And two persons are getting married.\np: This movie, with pop corns, I watch everyday. I get married, not the contract, but literal marry. It is my wife. I try to be the couple. Then open BBC live on youtube. Watch some people die. Then go back to park to jog and talk.\np: This is a real movie, where love is in the air right where death is.\np: Ok the next one.\nh3: What is your wife cooking?\nimg: cooking.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Cooking by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@devonrockola target=_blank>Devon Rockola</a>\np: My wife is cooking meals. Talking deals. Cleansing these wardrobes and in them these reels. Some dusting and some grooming. Today, when no one lets us go away, it is our wife who is in control and who is running our whole. She is cooking, planning and executing. I just have to match the pace. Like a race in a town where my wife wears the crown.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: track.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Track by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@alexander-dummer-37646 target=_blank>Alexander Dummer</a>\np: Things are getting back on track. Life is getting reasonable in the back. The world is healing and fabrics are feeling, the pain we carried on our back. Once for all, and all for once, we are hearing the pearls of sound. What it is, how it is, the quietness of air, the rights of the heir, who will rule and who will be cool.\np: Some have gotten strong and some have gone wrong. Some want to die now and some want to live the rest of the day. Some have grown the guts for living. Some have worn the masks for saving. Some are walking to run the life and some are stopping to find the life. Some are leading, some are growing and then there are some who are frowning. The ones who are dancing in the rain, are the ones who are finding the sane. Some who are closing their panes, are just dying in this game. This is love and then there is logic. One day love wins and all days logic grins. This is life, where poor is ripe and that is death, where covid is rife. Live one day, but live like you ran. You will die, for death is going to ram.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Everyday a thousand deaths in Spain is alarming. Laboratories are flooded with scientists day and night. Governments are putting huge chunks of money into <b>Vaccine research</b>. But, still no vaccine is around. Lack of cure is only fuelling fear and anxiety.\np: Consider these 3 x claims that <b class=lavendar>nature is healing</b>. It will tell you <b>how you can adopt to these methods</b> to stay clean, healthy and protected from Covid Corona Virus.\np.b-left: 1. Plasma therapy in China\np.b-left: 2.

Quran, Negative Assumptions and Corona\nh3: Plasma therapy in China\nimg.width-m-half: plasma.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Plasma therapy being used in China to boost people’s recovery, <a href= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-hospital-idUSKBN20B1M6 target=_blank>Link here</a>\np: Humans are made up of millions of living organisms. Each cell is alive; breathing, eating and living. The heart is alive, that beats for life of a human to pump blood. Blood, nails, hairs and vitamins are living organisms. These reproduce, multiply and die. Just like all the creatures around us, our body is made up of these similar creatures to keep us moving.\np: The new Virus, Covid 19, is another living organism. It multiplies after reproduction and dies after some fight inside our nervous system. Most people healing, are carrying stronger bodies, anti-bodies, to defeat the virus. As they fight it and get cured, their anti bodies are picked and transferred to people with weaker bodies, to build their immune system stronger. This method is called <b>Plasma Therapy</b>, which is currently being used to cure people.\np: Until a vaccine against Corona surfaces, the only remedy is our stronger immune system.\nh3: Earlier Pandemics Cure\nimg: h1n1.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Snippet from American Journal of Public Health, <a href= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4504358/ target=_blank>here</a>\np: If you go through the cures of previous pandemics in history, you will realise all of them had one thing in common. <b class=lavendar>People of good physical and mental health, were not affected by the viruses</b>. According to American Journal of Public Health (link above), use of natural resources reduces the risk of falling a victim to pandemic virus.\np: Some developed countries, UK and Sweden, are recommending people to get out of their homes to take sun light, jog and improve air intake to bodies.\np: The use of air and sun light, balances the harmonic production cycles of human body. This helps in reducing depression and anxiety. It also builds the immune system stronger and lets our bodies fight the infectious diseases naturally.\np: During these times, while vaccine is not available, it is strongly recommended that you get out of your homes, walk in parks and increase influx of nutrients required to beat the disease. Anything that gives you anxiety or depression, you have to close its doors immediately. Fear and panic will only make you more vulnerable to this deadly virus.\nh3: Quran, Negative Assumptions and Corona\nquote: O you who have believed, <b class=lavendar>avoid much [negative] assumption</b>. Indeed, some assumption is sin. <br> - Surah Al Hujraat verse 12\np: Most told about Corona is <b class=lavendar>assumption</b>. It will affect us in gatherings, not all gatherings only 0.1% of them. It will spread through cough, not all coughs are Corona only 0.1% of them. It will spread to kill millions, not yet happened and it is nothing but a negative assumption. These baseless assumptions promoting fear and panic are against the teachings of Quran.\np: It entails, we only label ourself / somebody else ‘a Corona infected’ after major symptoms surface. Until then, labelling victim and quarantining will only cause panic. As panic increases, the vulnerability of dying with Corona increases. This panic multiplies and results in lockdowns of communities. And once a lockdown has been set into place, the fear, more amount of negative assumptions and precautions will make it nearly impossible to lift the lockdown. And prolonged lockdown is only a downfall of a country.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: morning.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Morning by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@kaboompics target=_blank>Kaboompics</a>\np: Get closer to nature. Wake up early. Take shower. Go for a walk. Breathe in and out. Halt at a good spot. Meditate. Think good great things in your past. Find the present. Live here, in the park, for a moment. Get up. Go back home. Make tea. Serve your wife. Serve yourself. Dip your biscuits in your tea. Turn on the tv. Watch “tiny houses living big” on youtube. Get a hint how people design their life while in the nature. Observe the music and voice. How they edit these movies. Get closer to the artists. Understand them a little. Get out of the artificial and fake world. This is the time to live the real world. All green, cloudy and rainy. Live this world now, because soon it will go back to ruins. After the corona, the chaos will revert. Be happy, smile, and build yourself stronger. Because only cure to this disease is nature.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

There is a dire need to build ourselves stronger that we stop giving up on people. Read today’s blog to learn this necessary skill.\nimg: leader2.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Leader by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@fauxels target=_blank>Fauxels</a>\np: Just like all the skills, the ability to read and write, talk soberly and act maturely, this skill of “not giving up on people” can be learnt. It is linked with anger management and discipline. As you start controlling your anger and reactive-ness to things of personal disliking, you grow this skill of “not giving up on people”. <b class=lavendar>With less anger, comes discipline and maturity to handle issues</b>. That links you to the important skill of “leading people”. I will break this topic into three sections.\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>1.</b> Benefits of not giving up.\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>2.</b> Understanding the fight.\np.b-left: <b class=lavendar>3.</b> Self reward system\nh3: 1. Benefits of not giving up\nimg: blogging.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Blogging by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: Today is 90th day of writing this blog. For outsider it is one calm day everyday of focus sprint at a good view point. But for insider, it is a continuous fight. I want to give up every second of my life. It is difficult, takes toll on my mind and makes me feel irritated inside. But some negative remarks, some taunts around the day, boosts my morale and resolve to just get up and write.\np: With resolve and fight, you realise we all “people” are same. Angry on the outer layer, but as you peal it down, it is softer inside. We all love respect, personal example and push. We want to be taken care of even when we are giving the most hateful picture of us. We react sometimes and sometimes we are soft. While you are willing to get ahead of the crowd, you need to be willing to take the responsibility of not giving up on your people.\np: As you bring discipline, your family comes attacking you. You do not give up on them. Your friends taunt you. You do not give up on them. You colleagues snub you. You do not stop loving them. <b class=lavendar>If you are wanting to succeed and if you want to reach the pinnacle of an amazing life, act like Muhammad</b>. He never used to give up on his people.\np: It brings your ego down. Lifts your mood. Hardens your mettle. It purifies you and brings your people closer. It lets you build a bright, bold and happy community. It builds your brand and your company. This important skill, is needed for every body. A businessman, a trader and a lover. Pick a person, who wants success, he needs this skill.\nh3: 2. Understanding the fight\nimg: fight.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Fight by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: The fight against criticism, anger ridden mob and hurting comments from nearest is quite tough. Understand it, it is not easy. It is not possible for everybody. If you are not willing to get bloody, you are not really ready. Get up. Open your eyes. Move them. Look around. People who win, are willing fighters. Not soft hearted and lazy, but hardened and roughed. You need to be ready to face the wrath of your people, if you want to get into this fight.\np: Stop when you are done running. When you are wasted. When you are tired. Take few sips and resume your fight. Keep fighting, until you start finding its taste and rewards. Like Khalid, try to annihilate yourself, when you are standing in the battle. Roar like Zarrar, that people fear you. Speak like Abu Ubaida, that air carries your message. Fall like Abu Bakr, that people embrace you.\np: Be the mob, like companions of Prophet, that goes unshaken to all critiques, taunts and attacks. Understand it, it is not going to be easy, if you want to build one skill that surpasses all other skills of “not giving up on people”.\np: And, honestly, do not give me the crap, you are not Muhammad or Abu Bakar. You are exactly like them, just find that resolve hidden underneath your skin, to understand your true potential. You have all the capabilities and all the responsibilities that of our Prophet. Wake up!\nh3: 3. Self reward system\nimg: brownie.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Brownie by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@dana-tentis-118658 target=_blank>dana Tentis</a>\np: You are alone in this fight. So get used to rewarding yourself. You will not get money, neither acknowledgement. You will have to give it to yourself. <b class=lavendar>After every hit, go to a good bakery, buy a good muffin and eat it beside a lake</b>. Give yourself the reward and tell people how exactly you won the last fight.\np: Without rewards, acknowledgements and love, it gets messy. If you don’t see it coming, bring it upon yourself, yourself. Smile in the mirror. Count your steps and pat on your back. Move and on every fall, consider it a push forward in your rank. Fight harder and after every fight, reward yourself even bigger.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: love.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Love by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@cottonbro target=_blank>Cotton Bro</a>\np: As soon as you start loving your people, even those who negate you and deject you, you become a better human being. You care less how people react and more how you are moving forward. You see less. You judge less. You talk less. And you do more of what you want to achieve. You work more on your purpose. You find yourself in lesser conflicts. You do not find the need to justify your every action. All of your actions become just a step towards your goals.\np: Love these people. Do not give up on them. You will see the reward of Muhammad, Umar, Usman and Ali. You will reach your goal and stand victorious in this beautiful picture which is not inside a tv, but real. You will see tears and love, like you have never seen before. You will find yourself among the ranks of Muhammad and his likes. Soon, as you will die, you will see the miracles and light, that you will thank me, for telling you to ’not give up on people’.\nh3: Some todos 💥\np: This part is different from the blog above. But to make sure you guys follow along, please do these things today:-\np.b-left: 1. Call your most annoying relative and patch up.\np.b-left: 2. Call your never called before friend and just cosy up.\np.b-left: 3.

        "body": "h1: Best places to visit in Corona\np.note: While we are unable to get out of our homes, towns and cities, there must be these places which can cheer you up. Read today’s article to discover these hidden places.\nimg: closed.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Closed by Photo by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@timmossholder target=_blank>Tim Mossholder</a>\np: The most important thing to do right now is, get out of your comfort zone. Shake up your headache heavy head. Move your body a little. Shun this laziness away and get moving. Ride this fun filled roller coaster and visit some highly entertaining places, to lift your mood.\np: These are three places 👇\np.b-left: 1. Mosque\np.b-left: 2. Park\np.b-left: 3. Bakery\nh3: 1. Mosque\nimg: medina.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Medina by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@konevi target=_blank>Konevi</a>\np: Congratulations, mosques are open. If they are locked down, you can take your ‘jay e nmaz’ and sit outside your local mosque. (I saw one person praying at the door of a locked mosque yesterday). People would name you “stupid”, “ignorant” and a “threat”. But don’t worry, they will label you a “patient” if you will cough, sneeze or act different. Let them “label” you “ignorant” and you keep praying. You are alone here, otherwise, you would have spread Corona.\np: If you can’t find the courage to sit outside a mosque, call two of your close friends and gather at some quite place. Pray together in “Jamaat” and recite some Quran. Remember Allah a little. And His Muhammad a little. It will boost your moral, strengthen your immune system and will make you productive.\nh3: 2. Park\nimg: park.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Park by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@dominic-m-contreras-479765 target=_blank>Dominic M Contreras</a>\np: Good thing is, people won’t label you ignorant this time. Parks are open. Government is preaching to make people get out of their homes and get sun light. Sweat a little in the ground. Do some chin-ups and some sit-ups. Talk a little with strangers. Ensure you maintain the 2 meter distance between yourself and this stranger. Else Corona will kill you. Fear Corona. But it shouldn’t stop you from talking, jogging and exercising. Cheer up a little while you are out of the world of chaos where everyone is talking number of deaths happening every other second.\nh3: 3. Bakery\nimg: bakery.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Bakery by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@tuurt target=_blank>Tuur Tisseghem</a>\np: Third best and really beautiful place that will improve your mental and physical health is a “bakery”. They have not closed it yet. They are trying though that you stop eating also. But you and I, know we can not stop eating. Else we will die. So Bakeries are here to stay. We need them to survive.\np: Make maximum use of bakeries to find good chocolate muffins. Find some ‘russ milai’ and some ‘lassi’. Do not empty this shelf, but buy some, drink some and take home some. Act human and not stupid. Cheer your day up, with the warm lights, fuzzy filled freezers and endless racks of baked cookies in these bakeries.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: getit.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Get it by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@geralt target=_blank>Gerd Altmann</a>\np: Make use of this time when you have it, abundance of time. Try to minimise hours of dullness and boredom. Create some website. Draw a good painting. Write a good blog. Learn to be a carpenter. Cook something new. Teach a good course on youtube. Wanted to get rich back in old days of busy routine? Now is the time to get rich. All you have to do is kick in your productivity stream. Visit these places where Corona has not yet attacked. Find the energy and fire to get back up on your feet. It will make you rich while the world is “taking” measures, you need to “give” these measures. Be the creator of goodness. Avoid dullness, lazy-ness and lethargic-ness. Get out of this prison, now. Else it will get too late.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

It makes us live sober and stay committed to our faith.\nimg: quran1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Quran by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@abdghat target=_blank>Abdullah Ghatasheh</a>\np: We will answer three questions today;\np.b-left: 1.

Why did we come to the earth?\nimg: earth1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Earth by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@martinpechy target=_blank>Martin Péchy</a>\np: We were sitting in front of Allah. Raised a little and made the best of His creations. Allah orders Satan to prostrate. He takes pride in his fire-ly roots and negates orders. He is banished from heavens and is taken to earth. Allah calls him “<b class=lavendar>un worthy of staying in heavens</b>”.\np: Similarly, we commit a mistake. Eat from the forbidden tree and lose the heavenly dress. We go naked. We thought we will turn into angles and will live forever. Greed overtook us and we lost our right to stay in heavens and in abundance. It falls heavy on us. We are sent to this planet. Just another level in the heavens. And made to live for a small period of 70 years or 100.\np: So to answer the question, “why did we come here?” We came, to take the punishment. To qualify. To prove our worthiness of living in a paradise. To prove satan wrong. And to make Allah convinced, He was right when He was making us His caliph of this planet. It was to tell His people, we are messengers of Quran, Torah and Bible. We are the givers of good. We ourselves are responsible for lifting people and bringing the needed change. We, not our Prime Minister, not our Prophet, but we, ourselves.\nh3: 2.

Some flying around and some meeting our passed ones. It will be a different world. As the day of death comes, you will realise, you were living in a grave. Couldn’t leave the shackles.

This day it won’t be the same fan above your head, the same floor underneath. This day, it is different, some confusion and some rapid heart beats. A fear over your head, “some thing has attacked me from above”. You will feel helpless and weak, unable to move and get up. This force will take you out of your body and ask you one question; <b class=lavendar>Where are those you used to listen to beside Allah?</b>. You will not find the bosses, the neighbours and colleagues who gave you happy and calm advises. No father who used to stop you from waking up for Tahajhud. No mother, who loved you for running away from mosques. No one will be there. It will be all on you. The negations, the stoppings and the giving ups.

The door to an endless life is opening next, will you be giving up on this door. Won’t you will be wanting to enter the skies and meet your Prophet? Won’t you be wishing, you could get the window to the paradise. Won’t you will be looking above and loving the badly missed Allah? What will you be doing, if you got driven into this race of competition to getting into riches.\np: It is a huge life, a huge world, gigantic planets, flying creatures, running streams, beautiful birds, curvy roads and the only palace that deserves to be a palace ahead of you. The palace of Allah; the most beautiful, the highest and the endless.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: discipline.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Discipline by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@goumbik target=_blank>Lukas</a>\np: In past 3 months, of reading Quran and connecting to our mosque, I have found, there is only “one way” to live your life. No books, teachers and luxuries will give you the “abundance” but Quran. It is super  bright and fun book. It at times took me to skies to teach me the “creation of humans”. At times it took me to “womb” where I got birth. Some days it was Ibrahim fighting the world and some days it was Musa convincing the Pharoah. Some mountains got inverted and some people brought back to life. It told me, it is not just my office, laptop and home that exist in my life. There are people around, my parents, siblings, neighbours and colleagues. It taught me to weigh each person, when I weighed, I found every single human being weigh endless. At times, it took me to empty lounge, me lonely on stage, and at times it took me to filled hall and gazing people at me on stage. I have realised, this book is colorful, dynamic and bigger than everything I came across in my life.\np: Quran is a manual. Look at the magic. The world came into being. Next came humans. Next came a manual. Who could have found the serenity and love, without Quran? Who could have found sincerity with out the examples of Prophet. Who could have realised this world is just a stone without Quran. There are skies filled with similar stones. There are heavens and above far above in the skies, there is 1 sky. And then there are more of them. Who could have known and Who could have met our Creator without Quran. No one.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: How Corona is impacting Pakistan?\np.note: I am sitting in a bank, not so crowded inside, but lanes of people standing outside, is making me curious, how Corona is impacting our economy? Let’s discuss it step by step.\nimg: pakistan.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Pakistan by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@aadil target=_blank>Aa Dil</a>\np: Machinery of our country is people, working inside banks, alongside roads, in uniforms running inside hospitals. All of us, “make” our country. One road jam in Sindh, to a flood in Neelum are all cases carrying a weight that impacts us. <b class=lavendar>We are one single entity, that needs to work 24 / 7 / 365 without paper-jam to keep printing cash</b>.\np: Today’s topic is broken into 3 aspects;\np.b-left: 1. Economy\np.b-left: 2. Sincerity\np.b-left: 3. Faith\nh3: 1. Economy\nimg: economy.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Economy by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: Typically speaking, it is going down. Most of the countries, with strong foundations and sober banking systems are collapsing. But the good news is, it is not “collapsing” in Pakistan. Relatively speaking, our exchange has dropped 5000 points with fewer cases of Corona. May be lesser test kits and lesser identifications. But all the “lackings” are worth it. Lack of money is ensuring lack of sophistication towards identifying Corona in rural areas which is supplementing a broader sense of calmness prevailing in the country. People are finding it easier to gather courage to take bold steps, to move supply, to run shops and youth is gathering to push “Tiger Force” forward. With the lack of equipment, we are bringing people closer to fight the virus as one force.\np: If you take a broader picture of Pakistan, <b>people are relax</b>. Their immunity to virus is boosting. Maybe 100s are missed identified, but same lack of awareness is keeping them nearer to their loved ones. Not in prisons and cubicle trains. With closer vicinity, most are healing, connecting to their businesses and running the state’s machinery. This machinery is keeping the economy of Pakistan afloat. While Super Powers are diving down, we are swimming in tough waters to reach the shore. Prime Minister is talking of <b class=lavendar>donations</b>, <b class=lavendar>getting an excuse on debt from IMF</b> and <b class=lavendar>gaining sympathy to make banks invest into Pakistan</b>. With the “influx” of money, “love” of people abroad and “relaxed restrictions” from IMF, we might never plunge like western states.\np: To summarise, it is alright; the “virus”, “lack of equipment” and “curfew”. This all “missing” equipment and “inability” is naturally invested towards running our machinery. That says, we are fine “economically”.\nh3: 2. Sincerity\nimg: cooperation.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Cooperation by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@juanpphotoandvideo target=_blank>Juan Pablo Serrano Arenas</a>\np: Being the country built on “Islamic” constitution is by far the “wisest” and the “most helpful” thing that could happen to Pakistan. Muslims, naturally, are helpful. Some may commit sins, lies and murders. But the repentance of a muslim, purifies him to get back on his feet at once. No guilt and worries but all goodness, in a single click. The sincerity un-matched and love un-spoken, surfaces when we sit to watch Pakistan win cricket. The same Pakistani-at comes back alive when we hit Abhinandan down. This same love surfaces when we see the fence getting dugged in on rugged peaks of Bajaur and Waziristan. The same love surfaces when we see our Prime speak to world at UN. It is un-matched, love for Pakistan. It turns into “sincerity”. And in times of chaos, likes of now, it prevails to bring us closer.\np: This is not the first time a calamity has hit us. Unlike the richer states, we were in a state of conflict in 2007, when bombs shook us to our core. Conflict of 2001, when we stood to fight till our last, against India. Some more conflicts in 1987, when we fought Soviets to bring us to “Nuclear Power” tables. It has been happening, calamities have been hitting us, we have been dying for past few years. Not in 10s, but in 1000s. One nation, continuously falling to protect itself, won’t go down that easy. Some of us will be giving our own masks to protect our mothers and sisters. Some among us, will be walking in the deserts carrying the polio bags. Some will be driving trucks, to deliver the medics. Some will be standing on roundabouts to be a wall between Corona and our people. This nation, unlike “burger nations”, is here to stay.\nh3: 3. Faith\nimg: turkistan.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Turkistan by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@konevi target=_blank>Konevi</a>\np: This part is “I love” part. Faith ingresses into every bigger, successful, Oscar Winner picture. It created brands like Apple and space ships of the kinds of SpaceX. It is there in the most romantic scenes of history. The best wars are won on Faith. And the most beautiful things happened on this planet, are directly dependant on one category that surpasses all the ‘filtered categories’ is “Faith”.\np: Pakistan, Malaysia, Turkey are some bonds we take pride in. Turkish people love Pakistan. Pakistani people love Iran firing nukes on US bases in Iraq. Gaza standing its ground is loved by Malaysia. Bosniya to Rohingya is in our blood. Not due to their greener gardens and snow covered peaks. Neither because of their national footings. No left and right but only because of one ground; “Faith”.\np: Muslim alliance is huge but is covered with dust. Every attack on Mecca removes this dust. Some shunning in Kashmir, cleans up this alliance a little. More talks on Malaysia running a united bank in collaboration with Turkey and Pakistan, is not wise decision, neither correct. These are emotional decisions built on the foundation of “Faith”. These emotional footings, Corona filled calamities brings the muslims closer. It makes us stronger. We stand united not as “Pakistani” but as “Muslims”. This category is preventing the hurtful impact of Corona experienced in USA, in all Muslim states.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: syria.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Syria by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@samerdaboul target=_blank>Samer Daboul</a>\np: No Yemen is being fired at. No Syria is bombarded at. No Gaza, Kashmir, Rohingya, Bosnia or Uyghurs is happening for past 3 months. Weaker people are laughing at Richer people. Weaker cities at richer. And weaker countries at richer. Some Nurses crying with the fear of death in US, are being laughed at some Nurses embracing death in Pakistan. Some Primes self-isolating in Canada are being laughed at some Primes sitting in rumbles in Syria. Some who were punching the world are getting the punches. People of Faith are leading the masses of “Corona Infected Patients”. People of Pakistan are getting closer to attack Corona. It is an emotional scene, not because it is a strong economical country, neither because it has sincerity of IMF but only because it has Allah. The same Allah who protected Siachin till today, the same Allah who gave us Sipahi Maqbool Hussain in 71, the same Allah who brought us to victory in 65 and the exact same Allah who gave us Quaid-e-Azam, Salah Ud Din and Muhammad.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Success is not easy\np.note: It was a rough day. Tried to publish today’s blog while it was heavy and later came across our Meetup poster; again heavy. So, concluding already, <b class=lavendar>success is not easy</b>. It is tasty, fun and simple but not easy.\nimg: hardwork.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Hard Work by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@rquiros target=_blank>Rodolfo Quirós</a>\np: No successful person, ruler or industrialist, made to the podium of success with luck. Each one of them worked hard. They all died inside and shed tears to prove the world wrong and hit their goals. None of them, got there, through a shorter route. Pin it to your chest, if you want success in your life, “<b class=lavendar>do hard work</b>”. Because, all good things are a result of harder choices. Easy choices are cowardly acts called as <b>you justifying your actions to the world</b>.\np: I will be telling you three arenas, where hard work is rewarding me;\np.b-left: 1. 94th day of writing blog\np.b-left: 2. 4th Meetup on 5th April 2020\np.b-left: 3. 8th Chapter of Quran\nh3: 1. 94th Day of writing blog\nimg: rewrite.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Blog by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@suzyhazelwood target=_blank>Suzy Hazelwood</a>\np: When you put yourself in the shoes of a writer, you become a writer. You think like one. Your words are a depiction of images in your head, being directed, sorted and captured into words. It improves your imagination. Gives you better words. Decorates your sentences. Improves your personality.\np: I tried to write on 1st January 2020. It was hard, exciting and direction-less. Not the words and articles, but the direction of “<b class=lavendar>how I am going to make these blogs accessible to you</b>”, was direction-less. I just jumped and said it out loud, “<b class=lavendar>I am going to write on Quran everyday</b>”. Just that. No plans on how I will be unfolding the scripts. What people will be thinking about me. Where and when these blogs will start making a difference. Will I be able to stay committed or I will become an embarrassment. There was no clear direction, but just a voice in my head telling me to “Just Do It”.  And I just did it.\np: To write everyday for 94 days is not easy. It is tasteful, fun and simple, but the attempt of finding Content, Converting it into articles and Publishing is not easy. It is hard work. I have managed to reach 94 days through hard work. <span class=note> in’sha’Allah someday it will be 194 days</span>.\np: Commitment, Honesty and Truth are not happiness, these are the roads to happiness. One day I know, it will make me happier, because underneath, it is one aim; spiritual, religious and hardcore “<b class=lavendar>Make Quran Lit this World</b>”.\nh3: 2. 4th Meetup on 5th April\nimg.width-m-half: chapter4.png\np.text-center.caption: Chapter 4; Open Mic Morning in Pakistan\np: Second resolution for this year (2020) is to “<b class=lavendar>Arrange one Tech Meetup every month</b>”. Our tomorrow’s Meetup is virtual, online and will be streamed live on youtube <a href=https://youtu.be/vscn-HP932E target=_blank>at this link</a>. The list of speakers is healthy. We have become a group of nearly 31 people. All of us are trying to move forward together. The hard work, done on my own, to move forward, is not as rewarding, as it is done by “<b class=lavendar>31 solid</b>” people together.\np: There have been days when none of us were here and I was standing alone on the stage. I felt hardened, motivated and triggered. The <b class=lavendar>failure to convincing people to join me in the run of making Pakistan better, back in old days, told me to run faster, longer and harder</b>. Never did this failure managed to convince me to “<b>Give up</b>”.\np: These Meetups and Blogs are already making a difference. I am being held accountable. My fellow community members are being held accountable. We are trying to move everyday, sometimes by making a good flyer, at times by making a good tutorial video and other times sharing with fellow members of our achievements. All of this is required to keep a human brain lit with light and energy. It is required to keep our engines functional. The hard work is required to keep us productive. And a <b class=lavendar>productive brain is required to live a sober life in profession, at home and out in the public</b>.\nh3: 3. 8th Chapter of Quran\nimg: quran2.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Quran by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@tayebmezahdia target=_blank>Tayeb MEZAHDIA</a>\np: Before this year, Quran was just another book. I did not give due heed to its words. In English translation, it was absurdly written in old-age vocabulary. In Urdu, it was confusing. With hard work, continuous reading and not giving up on boring words, <b class=lavendar>it is turning into the brightest thing in my life</b>. The hard and tiring work in the mornings, is rewarding by unfolding new avenues of research. Each sentence when read in connection with adjacent sentences, is a different meaning. It never tells to kill people. It never speaks of hating others and above all it never tells Allah will punish people who will try to get closer to him. <b class=lavendar>Not reading, understanding and background knowledge, but hard work unveiled reality of Allah’s mercy on me</b>.\np: Quran alone, surpasses the blogging and meetups, as reward. But to make this Quran reach out to people, I need to write blogs. I need to arrange Meetups. I need to tell you, it is Quran underneath our skin, above in stars and deep in our oceans. The ant crawling to birds singing are inter-woven. There are hidden creatures around us, protecting us and cleansing our soul. Some micro organisms inside human body have their own souls. The heart has its soul. The flickering neurones are alive. <b class=lavendar>A human is not one “lively” being, but a combination of mega tons of “live” creations of Allah</b>.\np: Quran gives you hidden knowledge. It shows you unique patterns that are <b>undiscoverable</b> without this book. It is mega tons of inspiration, information and motivation. It is not readable, with out the “hard work”.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: greatday.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Poster by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@alexasfotos target=_blank>Alexas Fotos</a>\np: Wake up bro. Get out of your bed. Today is Saturday. Make a good presentation for tomorrow’s Meetup. Talk to people live on stage about goodness. Tell how you can make a difference. Talk how you can lit the world around you. Lift your mood. Sing and dance on stage. Go naked. Laugh out loud. Make yourself vulnerable. But be available. Jump ! We are here to catch you. We are here to push you and embrace your failures. We are here to tell you, you are not alone “failing”. We are “failing” with you. Do the <b>thing</b>. That one thing that shakes you inside out. That gives your life a meaning. That pushes your siblings forward. That makes you richer and happier. Just do “One” thing that you have been thinking about all your life. Do it now. Do not wait. Do not play safe. Do not live easy. <b class=lavendar>Pick the hardest “Choice” and start living your life “Today”</b>.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Speak Listen Act\np.note: Today I am speaking, like other fellow speakers, at our tech Meetup, while the tolerance is low, fear is spreading, the importance of speaking and listening can’t be under estimated.\nimg: speak1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Speak by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@mentatdgt-330508 target=_blank>mentatdgt</a>\np: Talk, listen and act are phenomenal creations. Each needs to be given its due time and focus, to be able to make good use of them. These features and functions can lift your image, boost your reputation and bring you to successes. These same features can take you to ruins.\np: Lets discuss three places where we can polish these skills to our advantage;\np.b-left: 1. Speak at a vulnerable place\np.b-left: 2. Listen to the pain triggering critique\np.b-left: 3. Act to prove above two places wrong\nh3: 1 👉 Speak at a vulnerable place\nimg: vulnerable.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Vulnerable by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@energepic-com-27411 target=_blank>Energepic</a>\np: It is not fun, speak to your fullest, not fun. Life is boring and tasteless, if you are not giving it the sprinkle of vulnerability. Playing safe and acting sober only dulls life’s color. <b class=lavendar>Playing hardcore, jumping blind and acting brave are extremely needed factors to make your life boring-less and taste-full</b>.\np: The best way to take this jump is a stage, where one slip of tongue, some broken sentences and badly prepared presentation is a direct attack on your hard earned reputation. It will take you down in artificial rankings of good ratings and trustworthiness. But it will bring you higher in your real life experiences that you will be banking on later in your life.\np: Speak, I can’t emphasise on it enough, on stage. Off stage. In gatherings. Make yourself vulnerable of getting attacked and ridiculed. It lets people make fun of you. Destroys your ego and unveils the real you, out to people around you.\nh3: 2 👉 Listen to the pain triggering critique\nimg: listen.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Listen by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@jonas-mohamadi-621232 target=_blank>Jonas Mohamadi</a>\np: Next step, after every talk, is a chain of critiques, suggestions and opinions. It is needed to trigger your pain points and train you harder, more than improving your talks.\np: Before you open your ears and start listening, reassure yourself of a strong “<b class=lavendar>belief in yourself</b>”. Without this belief, you wont survive the listening part. You might get crushed and left in shambles. You might go down the road of “giving up”. Negativity might over run you. You might fail, if you will fail at “believing in yourself”.\np: Open your ears. Take the suggestions. Embrace the criticism. Hug your haters. Go down with humility. Let your body take its toll. Fall like you wont get back up. Break like you start doubting all of your life’s efforts. Fail, fall and shed tears. <b class=lavendar>Without failing every day, you can not succeed one day</b>.\nh3: 3 👉 Act to prove above two places wrong\nimg: act.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Hard work by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@olly target=_blank>Andrea Piacquadio</a>\np: This part, where you act, is more important than the previous two. You can not reach the phase of “act” until there is a push. <b class=lavendar>Once you have put your life, reputation and earnings at stake, there is nothing stopping you from taking “actions”</b>. The first 2 phases of speaking boldly and falling bravely, takes you to acting strongly.\np: Did you feel “lazyness” in the morning, today? Did you feel like “not getting up - today it is Sunday”? Do you feel tomorrow’s “Monday” is going to be tough?\np: The sole answer to these questions is “you did not put anything at stake yesterday”. You will not be held accountable for lack of taking actions today, because you did not tell people, of your goals and commitments. You failed at running to your goal yesterday, and today you failed at taking the “actions” to move towards your goals. Lazy-ness, boredom and heavy-ness overtook you. You got defeated.\np: The “actions” are important if you want to achieve your goals. <b class=lavendar>Actions needs commitment</b>. You need to publicly commit yourself to taking actions everyday. You need to take the criticism and hits to find motivation to beat the world. <b class=lavendar>You, only you, need to take responsibility of your life, to live your life to its fullest</b>.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: insane.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Insane by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@ady-april-386980 target=_blank>Ady April</a>\np: Stop being logical. Stop acting sane. Stop thinking. Start acting. Start speaking. Start failing. Lose all of your earnings. If you won’t jump into fire today, you won’t succeed. If you will not think insane, you will not fall. If you won’t take the hits, you won’t act. If you won’t act yesterday, you won’t get up today. Act sooner. You have to make this world look towards Kaaba and honor it. You have to lead people to Jerusalem, to conquer it. You have to raise the slogans of Allah, to embrace it, the death. No one else, but you, you have to stand under hoz-e-koser, beside your Prophet. You have to take shelter under mercy of Allah on judgement day. Only you, have to cross the bridge to get into gardens of green fields, beautiful trees and endless streams. <b class=lavendar>Wake up, today, on Sunday, that you act on Monday</b>.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

Daughters are getting married. Elders are taking responsibility. Inheritances are being distributed fine. <b class=lavendar>During these days, when life has come to a halt, we are missing out the fun of living in Pakistan</b>.\np: There are three things which needs to be reminded to connect with the showers, winds and dark skies above us.\np.b-left: 1.

Prophet PBUH loved rains\nimg: desert.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Desert by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@walidphotoz target=_blank>Walid Ahmad</a>\np: Madina, just like Pakistan, was flourishing in old days. Tourism was booming. Religious delegations were booking hotels. Winds used to give a feel of calmness. Prophet PBUH was roaming in the streets. People were looking at him, finding connection with him, his God and finally to the mystical beauty of the deserts. Although, to a naked eye, there is nothing in Madina, but deserts. But back in the days of Prophet, it was a throne, bearer of flag of Islam, spreading the light in all its might. Life was good in Madina. Just like Pakistan, today, Madina back then had been blessed with countless blessings.\np: Prophet PBUH used to love rains. He says;\nquote: \"When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw storm clouds he would pace back and forth. And <b class=lavendar>when it rained, he would relax</b>.” She said; \"I said something to him about that, and he said; 'What do I know? Maybe it is as Allah, Most High said; Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys, they said; “<b class=lavendar>This is a cloud bringing us rain (46:24)</b>.”’ <br> - Jamiah Al Tirmidhi Hadith 3257\np: He loved Allah. Any message down from skies of Mercy used to lit his face. Water falling from skies, in abundance, reducing the temperature, giving chills to his body, used to make him smile and thankful to Allah (swt). Rains were bringers of thicker vegetation, richer corpses and healthier nation.\nh3: 2.

Get out of your homes, walk in the rain, with an umbrella, to your favorite spot. Sit there under the thunders, sound of water and smell of sand for some minutes. Talk to yourself. Ask your insane questions and answer them yourself. Talk your emotions, problems and values down a little. Eliminate the noises in your head. Find the fortresses and discover the jewls hidden inside you. Look at the bright side of \"your self\". It will draw new goals and create new sketches in your head.\nh3: 3. Make one commitment\nimg: pen.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Pen by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@tirachard-kumtanom-112571 target=_blank>Tirachard Kumtanom</a>\np: Write anything on a piece of paper. It involves, thinking of “where is the pen”, “Where is the diary”. Later it involves, “Should I pick it” decision making. Followed by energy and passion to move to the diary and pick it up. These small atomic habits are interlinked to take you to “taking actions”.\np: After the hard work, write one goal. Re-frame your thoughts on paper. How you are thinking of achieving it. What will happen after your achieve it. Draw it on a paper. Give your dreams a physical reality. If the \"reward\" is not worthy of putting all the effort, cut it down, tear apart the paper, throw it away. Act aggressively to your failures. Write the goal again. The \"reward\" and how you are planning to achieve it. Try to do it once or twice a day, and as it takes you to one goal, that really resonated with your personality. <b class=lavendar>Make a commitment of acting on it, publicly</b>.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: street.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Street by <a herf=https://unsplash.com/@freestocks target=_blank>Free stocks</a>\np: Fear is hurting our relationships.

But more I read Quran, I find, more it talks of walking blind and trusting your instincts. It is a risky book.\nimg: doit.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Motivation by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@valeria-ushakova-603898 target=_blank>Valeria Ushakova</a>\nquote: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"A man from Bani Israel asked someone from Bani Israel to give him a loan of one thousand Dinars and the later gave it to him. The debtor went on a voyage (when the time for the payment of the debt became due) but he did not find a boat, <b class=lavendar>so he took a piece of wood and bored it and put 1000 diners in it and threw it into the sea</b>. The creditor went out and took the piece of wood to his family to be used as fire-wood\". And the Prophet (ﷺ) narrated the narration (and said), \"<b class=lavendar>When he sawed the wood, he found his money.</b>\" <br> - Sahih al-Bukhari 1498\np: A wooden plank, floated into water, reaches its destination, is nothing logical, sane and trusting your guts. It is only courage and following your instincts blindly.\np: Today’s topic is explained in following phases;\np.b-left: 1. What is a fight\np.b-left: 2. How Quran encourages taking actions\nh3.lavendar: 1. What is a fight?\nimg: fight.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Photo by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@hellochrisgonzalez target=_blank>Chris Gonzalez</a>\np: The fight after you hit a dead end, is one kind. Fight where you take a stand to fulfil your uttered words, is another kind. One where you wake up early, perform ablution and reach your mosque is also a type of fight.\np: We are fighting every second of our life. The moment we start giving up, we start opting for easy choices and start neglecting the failures. We drop the charisma of life. That is why, fight is meant to be taken seriously, to conquer, to succeed and to live with grace.\nh3.lavendar: 2. How Quran encourages us to take actions?\nimg: quran3.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Quran by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@mloky96 target=_blank>Abdulmeilk Majed</a>\np: Following summaries are taken from our recent lessons in Surah Al Araf;\nh3.b-left: Summary 1 - Spread the Message\nquote: This is a Book revealed to you, - so let there not be in your hearts any uneasiness while you warn them and remind them. <br> Verse 2\np: Not only the disbelievers, but the believers, your siblings, relatives and neighbours. This ayat tells us to get out of our home, hold the Quran tight in our hands, knock at the door of fellow believers and remind them of the stories of Prophets.\np: Interestingly, the people will oppose you. Your society and profession will question your sanity. But this is what Quran says. It tells us to start committing to insane actions to bring forth the Quran.\nh3.b-left: Summary 2 - Fear the Punishment\nimg: fire2.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Fire by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\nquote: And how many cities have We destroyed, and Our punishment came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon. <br> Verse 4\np: Cities of Lut, Hud, Aad, Thamud, Shoaib, Saleh and un-ending lists of Prophets where Allah destroyed the people of great successes. All these cities were given message of Quran and introduction to Allah. People negated the message. They read it and spread it to get richer. At times it was exploited to rise in reputation. But they never embraced the message. Never acted and never succeeded on their deaths.\np: Corona is hot, live and spreading like fire. It is an exponential graph. Only people, who will embrace Quran, act on its message by distributing rations, writing blogs, making websites and becoming an example, will survive. The brave ones will live through like Nuh floated in waters, Lut rode out safe, Muhammad found Madina. But the cowards, people who read Quran and neglect the actions, will die of fear, panic and weakness.\nh3.b-left: Summary 3 - The weighing of Scale\nimg: scale.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Scale by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@mali target=_blank>Mali Maeder</a>\nquote: And the weighing of deeds that Day will be the “truth”. So those whose scales will be heavier, they will be successful. <br> Verse 8\np: Imagine, a scale hanging in front and fire in the background. Hell roaring, people crying, angels thudding people of weaker belief. Some being punished are richer, some are logical and some among them are poor begging on the streets and killing neighbours. Rich and Poor will be standing in one line. Faith and Courage will be standing on one line.\np: People who restrain their actions by becoming logical, sound and wisdom, never raise their weigh of good deeds. These deeds will be placed on the scale one day and you will wish you could have raised the slogan of Allah standing today on a round about. You could have acted like Quaid-e-Azam. Or you had acted like Khalid or like Muhammad. That day, when scales will be placed, our “wishes” will not help. Today, when we know scales will be placed, our “actions” will help.\nh3.b-left: Summary 4 - The pride\nimg: victory.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Victory by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\nquote: And We have certainly created you, and given you a form. Then We said to the angels, \"Prostrate to Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was not of those who prostrated. <br> Verse 11\np: It does not matter, whether you are a saint or a disbeliever. You are a giant or a coward. You are acting or not acting. The supreme requirement is to submit to Allah. In office, at home, in mosque, on the road, you need to fear the wrath of Allah.\np: Well, honestly, we are not afraid. Like Iblees, we are thinking, it is going fine. Death is fine. We are from Muhammad, we are safe. Inside, we are ok, with the nights of fun and gossip. Some days rest is ok. Some life and some fun is needed to cheer up. Inside, we are not afraid.\np: The Quran tells me, to walk with dhiker at my tongue, eyes pondering over the next stone on my path, the tree and its leaf, the birds chirp, cow grazing and clouds moving. Quran tells me to stop thinking of an easy life here. It tells me to jump with a blind faith, every second of my life. Else, my long nights of worship, beautiful recitations of Quran and sound athans are useless. I need to act now, that I die now, fearing Allah, that I succeed.\nh3.b-left: Summary 5 - Satanic Attack\nimg: horns.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Horns by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@katlovessteve target=_blank>Kat Jayne</a>\nquote: Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left, and You will not find most of them grateful [to You].\" <br> Verse 17\np: It is black and white, the Quran, Allah’s order and Satan’s intent. Black is cowardly actions, thinking we will lose our job, family and reputation. White is brave actions, thinking we do not need job, family and reputation but Allah.\np: Satan takes you away from the message of Allah. It shows luxury, comfort and happiness and gives “depression”, “misery” and “failures”.\np: Allah calls us to “failures”, “losses” and “death” in His path, and gives luxury, comfort and happiness.\np: As soon as you jump into fire, like Ibrahim, your fire will turn into a bed of roses. As soon as you will shout, Allah o Akbar, in the crowd, Allah will raise you in reputation. As soon as you will hit death with pride and love, Allah will give you wealth, legacy and Life.\np: And to tell you, life in death, is bigger, beautiful and colorful. The death of a believer is his meeting with Allah. The death of “black” is meeting with endless recurring and horrific deaths.\np: This Quran is black and white. It incites you to embrace death.\nh3.lavendar: Conclusion\nimg: retire.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Retire by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: You are not late. Your age does not matter. Your profession does not bind you. Your family is not a hurdle. Your reputation is not at stake. Your earnings will not go away. Your wealth will increase. Your profession will glow brighter. Your family will love you. Your society will respect you. Just take the Jump!\np: You will become Muhammad. You will rule Madina. You will fight Badr. You will swing the sword. You will ride the horses into Jerusalem. You will conquer Spain. You will build Baghdad. You will shine. You will rise. With Quran, you will not fail. It is a book of supreme powers. It will take you closer to the creator of Heavens, Skies, Earth and Muhammad.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

In the beginning, when there was only cruelty and murders. Poor were crushed by by Firown, Musa (as) had none with him. In all the misery and hopelessness, he discovered Allah. Who had shown him the way and strength to continue his fight against cruelty. This is a strong message for every believer to “act” on the message of Allah.\np: There are three phases of the fight;\np.b-left: 1. Situation before Musa (as)\np.b-left: 2. The Fight\np.b-left: 3. Situation after the Fight\nh3: 1. Situation before Musa (as) (Verse 103 - 108)\nimg: trade.jpg\np.caption.text-center: Trade by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@tomfisk target=_blank>Tom Fisk</a>\np: Society in times of Musa (as) was common people, busy in trades, running homes and governing the poor. The exact same society as of today, where we read Quran, find it amazing, go home, hurt sub ordinates and kill the purpose hidden under well-read Quran.\np: People of Firown were not different from us. They were as cruel and ruthless as we are today. In misery, where people were suffering and the literate were snubbing the poors, Musa (as) found Allah.\nh3.b-left: Allah selects Musa\np: Allah did not like this community. He did not like people murdering, fornicating and hurting. He selected Musa (as), the one guy, who will spread His message to His people. So inner instincts told Musa (as) to take action on his agendas. His inner instincts, which are from Allah, told him to correct the society, eliminate lawlessness and help the poor.\np: Just like Muhammad, Musa (as) took the initiative and went straight to Firown, the king of the time. Thinking, the easiest way to solve the problems, is by “connecting” to the king of the nation. The king, just like all of our kings today, was an anger ridden emotional guy. He did not pay heed to the message of Allah. And Allah, in response said, “<b>Now see what I do to these people</b> (Verse 103)”.\nh3.b-left: Musa is given Miracles\np: The Situation gets messy now, Allah has involved himself, literally to helping Musa (as) by giving him 2 x Miracles.\np.b-left: 1. Musa (as)’s hand had the light, a powerful glow, that would break the lens of an eye.\np.b-left: 2. Next he had the staff, a stick, that would turn into a snake.\np: Normal miracles given to a normal human being. For Allah, these are just normal, to invert the mountain, to destroy the nations and bring annihilation. <b>Allah puts effort only in creating things of utter beauty; making the planet “earth”, designing the “eye” of a human being and bring the “showers” from skies</b>. Destruction, is nothing but one simple Act, for Allah.\np: Followers of Firown will now see the destruction as people of today’s world are seeing at the hands of Corona.\np: Miracles are given. Next nears the fight with Firown. Musa (as) asks for his brother to accompany him in his mission to fight against Firown. Allah blesses Musa (as) with his brother, Haroon. Two man army is now ready to show the world “<b>The power of Allah</b>”.\nh3: 2. The Fight (Verse 109 - 120)\nimg: red.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Red by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@may-215849 target=_blank>May</a>\np: The army lead by Musa (as), accompanied with angels who are about to witness the best fight. The fight of poor vs rich, Musa vs Firown, Allah vs Satan. This is the turning point of the battle.\np: Horns are ringing. Hooters are blowing. Angels are gathering. The trees, earth and skies are going to witness Allah’s punishment on Firown. The poor, the angels and the skies are “happy”, for the poor and injured human being (Musa) is going to be <b>helped</b> in a moment, in all its might.\nh3.b-left: The Attack\np: The army of Musa (as) approaches the fortress of Firown. Fortress is well guarded. Roads are well lit. Gardens are well maintained. People are poring water on flowers. Businesses are happening. Trade is flowing. Money is coming in. Egypt is flourishing and people (literate, hardworking, gazetted) are happy. Some poor are suffering at the hands of the educated. Just a normal day in the kingdom of Firown.\np: Musa (as), one man army, with Allah, one hand glowing and one hand holding the staff, approaches the Firown and asks him “<b class=lavendar>Send Bani Israel with me</b>” (verse 105).\np: Firown laughs, ridicules and the people in his governance, raise the laughter louder. All mimic, humiliate Musa. But as they see him standing his ground, firm and un shaken by the ridicules, they get confused. He is still standing there. When the hall’s tone of voice mellows down, people realise, Musa is neither ridiculed nor fearful.\np.b-left: The ministers and colleagues of Firown asks the king;\np.b-left: <b>“He wants to throw you out of Egypt, Firown. What do you say we do to him?</b>\np: A gap. Some confusion is prevailing and when Musa (as) shows them the glowing hands and fearless face. People in surprise and fear, name him a “Magician”.\np.b-left: They say;\np.b-left: <b>“May be we should not throw Musa out right now. May be we should give him and his brother some time.”</b>\np: More gap. The confusion is now raising. People who were laughing are now hiding inside their chests. The fear is oozing out of their faces. The army of Allah, is not weak. It can not break, neither melt. When it takes its stand, it does not lose to some taunts and some ridicules.\np.b-left: They say;\np.b-left: <b>“We will gather some magicians to fight Musa (as)”.</b>\nh3.b-left: Quest for Magicians\np: Routine life falls back to the kingdom. Same trade routes are being used to bring in the crops and rations. Schools open. Universities start taking exams. Parents are going to offices. While the Firown and his team is gathering the magicians, the state matters are being run smoothly.\np: Some curiosity develops in people as days passes by and they hear the need of magicians by the government. Some hear the existence of Musa as “a person with the glowing hand”. The voice of calmness turns into excitement and nervous-ness. People start gathering and start planning to witness the big show.\np: Some more days pass. Magicians have gathered. The stage has been prepared. The magicians are standing on one side of the court and Musa (as) on the other. The experienced, hardened and famous magicians, some who have won the Awards and some who have accumulated huge wealths are about to unleash their powers on Musa.\np: Fight is about to begin. Firown is excited. His people gathered in huge numbers up in podiums are biting their nails. Expecting the defeat of Musa followed by an exemplified murder by Firown.\nh3.b-left: The Drum Beat\nimg.width-m-half: drum.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Drum by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@game-of-light target=_blank>Sankalpa Joshi</a>\np: <b class=lavendar>The fight begins</b>. Drums beat. Roaring voices in the skies. Some people laughing. Some hugging their friends. Some joining the podium now. Clapping, thudding and digging. Magicians are throwing snakes around. The ground is filled with dread-ly and dangerous snakes. Some people “wooing” at Musa (as). Some feeling bad for him. But the excitement of the stage well lit is all out there, loud and clear. The stage on ground, <b>established by Firown</b>. In skies, <b>planned by Allah</b>. The angels beside, skies above and soil underneath, is waiting to see the attack of Allah’s army on the roaring voices and excited hearts.\np: It was obvious, Musa (as) was going down. He was going to be burnt alive by the people of Firown. The ministers were going to annihilate him, then his brother. The people were about to see the most deadly attack on any human being alive at the hands of the most cruel person alive.\nh3.b-left: The tipping point\nimg: kalma.jpg\np.text-center.caption: By <a href=http://thefinalreminder.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-conditions-of-la-ilaha-illallah.html target=_blank>The Final Reminder</a>\np: But the tipping point, is about to come. Something new, the world is about to witness.\np: <b class=lavendar>Musa (as), opens the staff</b>, beats it down, shouts the kalma of trust in Allah, and roars into the ground. The sky melts down. Allah is about to launch the attack. The staff, one stick, turns into a gigantic bringer of wrath. The people lose their ground. They did not see the dreadliness before. They forgot the voices and got nearer to the roar. In a moment, the stick, turned into snake, eats the snakes. Magicians are shut. Never witnessed a magic of this might. Never had they seen a person this brave. Never had they heard the roar of Allah this loud. It breaks their barriers of normalcy and logic. They, the people up in podiums, some in ministers, go down in “Sajood”. They accept the call and submit to the loudest, bravest and boldest call to Allah.\nh3: 3. Situation after the Fight (Verse 123 - 128)\np: The Firown is sitting in shock. People left him, in a click. But he can’t see the magic of Allah. The blood bath of poors have blinded him. He has gone mad in violence. Sanity and reality won’t hit him. Can’t see, can’t feel, destined for destruction.\np.b-left: In the anger and hit of failures, Firown warns his people;\np.b-left: “<b>You have left me without my permission. I am throwing you out of my kingdom. Now you will be opened to reality of my wrath. I will cut your right arms and left legs. Then I will hang you</b>”.\np: People who had found Allah a while ago, in the podium, when fear was looming, were in shock and submission.\np.b-left: They responded;\np.b-left: “<b>As you will hang us, we will go to our Allah.</b>”\np: Firown’s anger furthers. Goes aggressive. His people incites him to take action.\np.b-left: Responds abhorrently;\np.b-left: “<b>I am in control. I will kill your sons and leave your daughters alive</b>.”\np: Finally, when the people have started to gather their emotions and get back to sanity. When reality strikes them, they melt inside. The fear of Firown and his power, starts over-running them.\np.b-left: Finally Musa (as) gives hope to his people;\nquote.b-left: Seek help through Allah and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah. He causes to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous. <br>- Surah Al Araf Verse 128\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: normal.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Normal by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: The world is designed this way. It attracts you to get further away from reality. When a calamity strikes us, we start finding Allah. When we are taken out of calamity, we start becoming logical. We start putting in more effort to get a good grade, find a bigger house and leave a legacy behind.\np: People without kids are told to give birth to kids. People with kids are told to raise them to become logical and responsible beings. People with good professions are told to maintain them. People are telling, living some body’s else’s life, all their life. And after all the effort, <b>the reality strikes us, in our sleeps or in our days</b>. (Surah Al Araf verse 98).\np: Allah told us the story of Musa (as). Earlier the story of Shoaib (verse 85 - 93). Before that, story of Lut (verse 80 - 84). Before Lut, story of Saleh (verse 73 - 79). Hud (verse 65 - 72). Nuh (verse 59 - 64).\nh3.b-left: Why is Allah telling us the stories of Prophets?\np: He wants us to act like one. He wants us to take stand like Nuh. He wants us to act like Hud. He wants us to protect the words of Allah like Saleh. He wants us to stop adultery like Lut. He wants us to point out corruption like Shoaib. He wants us to fight Firown like Musa (as). He does not want us to give birth to kids, raise logical creatures and get a good Masters degree. <b class=lavendar>He wants us to fight for Him and die for Him</b>.",

Tiger Force will suppliment Government's efforts to identify these people.\ndropdownH: 4+ <span>12:32 - 14:49</span> <span>Explanation of Tiger Force by Usman Dar</span>\ndropdownF: 4+ Usman Dar is Special Adviser to the Prime Minister on Youth Affairs.\ndropdownF: 4+ Strength of people registered from each province is; <br><span class=w-50> Punjab</span><span> 5 Lac</span><br> <span class=w-50> Sindh </span><span>1 Lac </span> <br><span class=w-50>KPK</span><span>90,000</span><br> <span class=w-50>Baluchistan</span><span>10,000</span><br> <span class=w-50>AJK</span><span>8,000</span><br> <span class=w-50>GB</span><span>4,000</span>\ndropdownF: 4+ Total Strength:- <br> <span class=w-50>Male</span><span>7.5 Lac</span><br> <span class=w-50>Female</span><span>25,000</span>\ndropdownF: 4+ Health Workers:- <br> <span class=w-50>Health Workers</span><span>10,000</span><br> <span class=w-50>MBBS Doctors</span><span>2,000</span>\ndropdownF: 4+ All elected members across the Pakistan are by default part of the Tiger Force.\ndropdownH: 5+ <span>14:50 - 18:09</span> <span>Imran Khan explains Tiger Force</span>\ndropdownF: 5+ Distribution of funds is merit based and transparent. Just like the distribution currently carried out in Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital, no difference of race and creed will be found in selection process of  this force. Sincere efforts were done to formulate the policies and principles for controlling this force. Once Corona reaches its peak in Pakistan, Tiger Force will play an important role in running the country.\ndropdownF: 5+ Distribution of funds to people in crises is a crucial part of efforts being done at Government level. Unlike developed countries like USA (1000 Arab Billion USD Relief Package), Germany (1000 Arab Euro Relief Package) and Japan (1000 Arab Dollar Relief Package), Pakistan is giving only 8 Arab USD relief to afflicted homes.\ndropdownH: 6+ <span>18:10 - 25:29</span> <span> Dr Sania explains Corona’s Relief </span>\ndropdownF: 6+ Dr Sania referred to her 3 Days old interview with media where she explained complete dynamics of Corona's relief efforts. You can see her press conference <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9arbD6_uLDc target=_blank>at this link</a>.\ndropdownF: 6+ Distribution of Rs 12,000 among 120 Million people will start tomorrow (Today 9 Apr 2020). As the system is completely secured by biometric verification there is little to no chance of system abuse. All provinces have been taken on board to bring the uniformity into the system.\ndropdownF: 6+ Government employees can update the lists on NADRA’s portal page by <a href=https://ehsas.nadra.gov.pk target=_blank>clicking here</a>.\ndropdownF: 6+ According to PM, this program has been completed after 8 x months of hard work.\ndropdownF: 6+ <b>The Process</b> <br> <span class=w-50>1.

Most have lost their jobs. We want to bring them back to Pakistan on immediate basis. But to control the spread of virus, necessary plannings have been carried out. National Command and Operations Centre has concluded that these people will be brought back and kept in Quarantine for a specific period of time before they are allowed to go home.\ndropdownH: 8+ <span>28:56 - 30:39</span> <span> Efforts for Health Workers by PM Imran Khan </span>\ndropdownF: 8+ Front line fighters against Corona Virus are our Doctors, Nurses and Health workers. These people are in need of equipment to bravely fight the virus. Chairman NDMA is already distributing the gadgetries across the country (explains later).\ndropdownF: 8+ Recently a strike was carried out by Young Doctor’s Association against the police. It was a painful incident as people, involved, did now know of quantitative efforts being done by the Government.\ndropdownH: 9+ <span>30:40 - 37:12</span> <span> Distribution of Health Equipment by Chairman NDMA </span>\ndropdownF: 9+ Since 13 March, only 3 Provinces has responded with required data of equipment; Punjab, Sindh and KPK.

We can not put people into cells for getting out of their homes. It is each and every Pakistani’s responsibility to take precautionary measures and stay indoors.\ndropdownF: 11+ We are operating from National Command and Operations Centre in Islamabad, where people from all organisations are taking key decisions to keep the country running and fighting. People at no point should lose trust in us. We are looking at you. We are putting in every bit of ourselves to make sure our people are not left alone.\ndropdownF: 11+ With Ehsas program, in’sha’Allah we will distribute cash of Rs 12,000 to 120,000,000 people in a period of 2.5 weeks. People who are left out of the scheme will be reached out as future donations are received under Covid Fund Raising Program.\ndropdownF: 11+ There are two powers who are keeping Pakistan afloat in this crises. <br><span class=w-50>1.

Do not trust on un-authorised links circulating on internet. Or you can <a href=https://www.nbp.com.pk/COVIDFUND/index.aspx target=_blank>click on this link</a> to jump right into National Bank of Pakistan’s page mentioned in above tweet.\np: You can pay using Credit Card or Online Bank Transfer.\nh3.lavendar: Conclusion\nimg: faisal.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Faisal Mosque by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@sbjshah target=_blank>Syed Bilal Javaid</a>\np: Guys, this is the time to help Pakistan. It is time to unite and fix the country. Now is the time to get to work to helping the poor and delivering the rations. Do not send your donations to decentralised organisations in Pakistan. Send your donations directly to PM Imran Khan’s funds. It is being monitored by highly trained people like <a href=https://twitter.com/taidrus target=_blank>Tania Andrus</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/SaniaNishtar target=_blank>Dr Sania</a>. People have worked tirelessly to construct a system where only people of merit will be able to participate and receive your donations.\np: Pakistan is filled with filthy streets and useless noises. You are attacked upon by people who are addicted to begging on streets. Your donation bags are snatched away from you. The moment you enter these streets, you are pulled down and dragged to your breaking point. Professional beggars are eating up the rights of daily wagers, affected people and broken houses.\np: The real people in trouble, who are unable to extend their hands out of respect, need your donations. If you want to reach out to these people, trust the <a href=http://pass.gov.pk/ target=_blank>Ehsas program</a> that is centrally connected on NADRA System, well researched and being run by experienced people, who are running welfare schemes for over 20 years.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Day 100 - Announcement\np.note: I started writing on 1st Jan 2020. Today it is 100th day blog. I have found a “mission” that I will be trying to complete in next few days. It is sister Sajida from Jalal Pur, Gujrat. I am going to help her establish a school. I will ask you for donations, today, for myself.\nimg: school.jpg\np.text-center.caption: School by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: Sajida, is my sister, among 51% girls in Pakistan and 80% men who are in welfare systems. She was alone, had a daughter, special, couldn’t move and live on her own. Countless struggles, criticisms and humiliating comments made her question the Justice of Allah. She felt alone and isolated.\np: While the world around her was collapsing. Inside she was dying. Her daughter was suffering. She, unlike most girls, did not think for a moment, she is a “girl”. She can be divorced or banished. She can be laughed at or mocked. She decided to build a school for special children and fight to prove everyone wrong. 10 years back, in shambles and broken world, far away from our rich lands and decorated houses in a village on the cross roads of city Gujrat, Jalal Pur Jattan.\np: She ran, fell, got back up, ran and fell. Countless failures, unending violence and heart breaking comments, did not melt her resolve. She is still running, taking classes, arguing with the land owner, the mafia of society and hurling back the stones. She is still standing guard to her fortress. She is still fighting alone. In the misery when people are attacking, she is still looking for people to reach out to her and help her.\np: Looking at her struggles, I question myself, how do God make people of this kind? How do He create their souls? What colors are there in His shelf? How does He think? Looking at her, makes me believe, Allah is beautiful. More beautiful than everything I have seen in my entire life. More lovely and amazing than all the skies, mountains and stories. Why would you not like to meet Him. Why would you not like to be the Musa or Muhammad. What stops you from one death on His way and then endless days, months and years with Him.\np: Nothing stops us from meeting our Allah. Nothing stopped Sajida from raising the slogan to build a school. Not people, ambushes and gun attacks. Not violence. Not hurling stones. Not logic and lack of money. She decided like Muhammad, she will fix the world. She built a school like Abu Ubaida. She wore her armour like Khalid. She just went out there in the deserts of Arab and stood her feet. No Persian, Roman or Abu Jahal, could defeat her in 10 years.\np: I talked to her, I found one person, as mad as me. As abnormal and as stupid as me. One person, I am going to fight for and raise funds for. I will build a school. That will lead to more schools. More Googles and Microsofts. I will fight like Zarrar across the tunnel and die like Ikrama. One day, when the world shakes and dies, I will stand closer to Muhammad, Abu Bakr, Umar and Ali. I will hug them, hold their hands and go to Jannat Ul Firdous. I will prove the world wrong. I will fight, have greatest meetups in the world, the best schools and the most following on twitter. I, with my sister Sajida, with my brothers following the Muhammad, will run, ride horses, take out our swords, wearing armour will conquer Jerusalem.\np: Just said it, <b class=lavendar>the purpose of my life. To conquer Jerusalem, to unite muslims and to die in the way of Allah</b>. I won’t stop. I won’t, until I die in the most beautiful’s way.\np: Today’s topic is spread over three sub topics\np.b-left: 1. How we are going to build the School?\np.b-left: 2. How you can help us?\np.b-left: 3. Conclusion\nh3.lavendar: 1. How we are going to build the school\nimg: checklist.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Check List by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\nh3.b-left: My strengths\np: I have been coding web for nearly 3 years. I have realised when I put a persistent effort into completing the work, it stands out. I have managed to build this website from scratch, white paper and black screens in 1 year.  There are courses on <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/school target=_blank>zakatlists.com/school</a> being run at my university, followed by these blogs under <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/qurandaily  target=_blank>Quran Daily</a> and recently constructed a dashboard for <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/covid19 target=_blank>corona patients</a> of Pakistan. Today is 100th day of writing blogs.\np: I am a very hard working person. I take my tasks very seriously. Writing these blogs also includes customised designing in Figma, development of bullets, quote commas beside quotations and manually writing Hex code for colours. It requires extreme hard work to balance the timings for writing the content, developing the web and giving due time to colleagues, friends and family. Just like Muhammad (PBUH), I am trying to balance all avenues of my life.\nh3: The Plan\np: Most works at the schools related to idea validation, designing floor plans and availability of property all already complete. Step wise details of the project are as under:-\nh3.b-left: Works already done\nimg: laurelclass1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Class Room of Laurel Home School\nh4.b-left: 1. No of students and Income\np: Sister Sajida, is running her school in a rented out building in Jalal Pur. She currently has 153 x students from her home town and 13 x Teachers. She is paying, Rs 50,000 a month, rent to the property owner. Details of school and expenses are written below:-\ntable: <tr>        <th>Class</th>        <th>No of Students</th>        <th>Subjects</th>        <th>Monthly Income</th>      </tr>      <tr>        <td>Play & Nursery</td>        <td>26</td>        <td rowspan=\"11\">English <br> Urdu <br> Math <br> General Knowledge </td>       <td>Rs 26,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td>Prep</td>       <td>20</td>        <td>Rs 20,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td>One</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>Rs 15,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td>Two</td>        <td>14</td>        <td>Rs 14,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td>Three</td>        <td>13</td>        <td>Rs 13,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td>Four</td>       <td>11</td>        <td>Rs 11,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td>Five</td>        <td>14</td>        <td>Rs 12,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td>Six</td>        <td>5</td>       <td>Rs 5,500</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td>Seven</td>        <td>6</td>        <td>Rs 7,000</td>      </tr>     <tr>        <td>Eight</td>        <td>4</td>        <td>Rs 5,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td>Special</td>        <td>13</td>        <td>Rs 10,000</td>      </tr>     <tr>        <td>Quran Hifz</td>        <td>12</td>        <td>Quran <br> English <br> Urdu <br> Math </td>        <td>Rs 5,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td colspan=\"3\">Staff Pays</td>        <td>Rs 1,20,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td colspan=\"3\">Building Rent</td>        <td>88,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td colspan=\"3\">Miscellaneous Bills</td>        <td>12,000</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <th colspan=\"3\">Net Loss</th>        <th>- Rs 30,000</th>      </tr>\np.text-center.caption: Expenses of Laurel Home School\nh4.b-left: 2. Rotation of expenses\np: She is currently experiencing losses in her net income nearing Rs 30,000 a month (mentioned in table above). Her husband and colleagues are helping in running the school. In spite of all the hurdles, she is managing her bills, employees’ pay and rent of the building. Underneath it, is the support of Allah that has brought her to running a successful school today.\nh4.b-left: 3. Availability of property\np: Presently the school is being run in a rented out building. She has <b class=lavendar>relocated the entire setup of school four times in 10 years</b>. As soon as the property owners see the traffic of students, the rikshaws dropping the students and business running, they ask for more. The \"desire of more\" of land owners is hurting the overall purpose of this project. There have been more than 500 admissions in the school. But the current number of students is halted at 153.\np: Continuous shifting and non availability of a proper place is making it difficult to finish the courses on a consistent basis. Mostly parents give up due to distant relocation of the school from previous location. Lack of a dedicated building is placing a toll on smooth running of the setup.\nimg: laurelplot1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Plot owned by Sister Sajida\np: Sajida has inherited a plot of 12 Marlas from her parents. Subtract the road and boundary, it amounts to nearly 10.5 Marlas of space. The land is sufficient to start the construction works.\nh4.b-left: 4. Drawing of the building\nimg: laureldrawing.png\np.text-center.caption: Left; Ground Floor Plan, Right; Basement Plan\np: The drawing of the school has been prepared. There are 4 x class rooms, 2 x offices, 1 x hall and 1 x store. The plan is limited to one floor only. However, second floor will be constructed if need arises.\nh3.b-left: Pending works\nh4.b-left: 1. Market the fund raising request\np: This is our first attempt at marketing the Fund Raising request. After this blog is published I will make a dedicated banner for the school at <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com target=_blank>zakatlists.com</a>, visible right at the top of the page.\np: We will keep the entire process transparent; the flow of funds, drawings and construction works by routinely sharing the pictures at following places.\np.b-left: <a href=https://twitter.com/LaurelHomeScho1 target=_blank>twitter</a>\np.b-left: <a href=https://www.facebook.com/laurelhome.laurelhome target=_blank>facebook</a>\nh4.b-left: 2. Make a banner on zakatlists\np: Zakatlists is getting a new header after this blog. It will show donations comparison with a link to this blog. As this project grows, I will be adding a dedicated page for the school on my website, <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com target=_blank>zakatlists</a>.\nh4.b-left: 3. 3D drawing of the building\np: 3D Drawing is a compulsory step before starting construction works. It will give us a clarity of our decisions on 2D floor plan and choice of furniture, colors and training aids. After the drawing and repeated iterations we will reach to calculating the exact amount of funds needed.\np: The progress of drawing will be shared on the <a href=https://twitter.com/LaurelHomeScho1 target=_blank>twitter</a> page.\nh4.b-left: 4. Construction 🚧\np: Construction of this school is Sajida’s dream. One day the school will become a reality. The children will be laughing, swinging and glowing with the same amount of passion, energy and love, as of Sajida. It can take some months, even some years. But the core values of this struggle can not be forgotten. <b class=lavendar>It is always “the journey” that matters</b>.\np: A close friend of mine has been encouraging me these past few days, I would share its screen shot here.\nimg: aashir.jpg\np.text-center.caption: You can find him on <a href=https://www.twitter.com/justaashir target=_blank>twitter</a>\nh3.lavendar: How you can help us\nimg: hobby.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Hobby by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@jeshoots-com-147458 target=_blank>JE Shoots</a>\np: The next most important question for me, is how you can help me. To be honest, I need you. Without your assistance, I am unable to move forward. But to pin point the exact areas “How” I need you, please read following 4 points.\nh3.b-left: 1. Encourage Me\np: I need a lot of encouragement. I am failing in most areas of my life. But while I am unable to give you a call, stay committed to my promises, lose some todos and miss the hits, the most important is, you do not focus on these areas. You do not focus on my negatives. You continuously send me encouraging messages. Just saying it, “<b class=lavendar>You wrote good today</b>” cheers me up and lights up my day.\nh3.b-left: 2. Attend our Meetups\np: We are conducting 1 Meetup every month. There is no dis-honest discussion, loose talk or bad agenda. We are discussing our failures, struggles and hardships. Collectively, each day, we move a little forward to our goals. These meetups are becoming a source of inspiration to learn new skills, write blogs and bring in discipline to our life. Underneath these meetups, we are trying to connect with the Quran.\np: You can join our Meetup page on meetup.com at <a href=https://meetup.com/techshek target=_blank>this link</a>, to stay tuned to our announcements.\nh3.b-left: 3. Start a hobby\np: Hobbies are colorful avenues of your life. These are superimposing factors to paint your relationships, professions and routine todos with good colors. We are linked with purposes and goals by default.\nquote: And <b class=lavendar>when your Lord took from the children of Adam</b> - from their loins - their descendants and <b class=lavendar>made them testify of themselves</b>, [saying to them], \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, “<b class=lavendar>Yes, we have testified</b>.” [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, \"Indeed, we were unaware of this.” <br> - Surah Al Araf verse 172\np: Every human being, is by default, a muslim. According to the verse above, the person roaming in jungles to living in cities, are all similar in their nature. They all know the right way of living their life. Some give up on easier attractions and some on harder choices. Successful are one, who never give up and finally find the truth.\np: Our truths can only be discovered after we make a resolve to finding the truth. <b class=lavendar>Hobbies are these secret ingredients that gives you a purpose, direction and contentment</b>.\np: Commit today to living your life to the fullest. Select a good hobby. Text me. It will boost my motivation to work harder to make these dreams a reality.\nh3.b-left: 4.

I might never find a chance to buy 1 brick for the school. I might never raise sufficient donations. I might fail. But just like today, the 100th day, I will not stop chasing my dreams. I will keep asking you for funds, to write blogs, to share your struggles and to discuss Quran. I will keep looking for inspiration from you. Just like Muhammad, I will keep striving hard to find the goodness, burried deep into the dust, in this world. I will not give up on people. I will not get angry. I will not hate. I will only live.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project. Please follow this project's page on twitter. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zakatlists\">Click here to go to the twitter page</a>.",

        "body": "h1: Let us praise Allah\np.note: Just read the last verse of Surah Al Araf, verse 206, where Allah asks us to praise Him and honour Him.\nimg: nature1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Nature by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\nquote: Indeed, those who are <b class=lavendar>near your Lord</b> are <b class=lavendar>not prevented by arrogance </b>from His worship, and <b class=lavendar>they praise Him</b>, and <b class=lavendar>to Him they prostrate</b>.\np: Todays topic is broken into following parts. We need to ponder over following 4 places quite seriously.\np.b-left: 1. Near your Allah\np.b-left: 2. Do not take pride\np.b-left: 3. Praise Him\np.b-left: 4. Prostrate to Him\nh3.lavendar: 1. Near your Allah\nimg: microscope.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Microscope by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: Allah exists, physically, around us. Just like Musa (as) couldn’t see Him. We humans, can’t see Him. It is not because, you need the seeing of Allah, to believe. It is because, you are asking too much. Let me explain it to you 👇\nh3.b-left: Explaining the desire to see Allah\np: Allah has made a human being. It is built with bones, flesh and blood. There are some organisms that constitute our body.\nimg: body.png\np.text-center.caption: Percentage of elements, <a href= https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_human_body target_blank>learn more</a>.\np: These elements are one out of 118 possible elements (so far discovered) that exists around us. Our Body, this tree, that building, fly buzzing around are these 118 periodic table elements, combined in different orders, to shape our world.\np: These elements, inside Protons, deeper Neutrons and Quarks, are living organisms. If you can’t see them “moving” like they are “alive”, try looking any of the elements under a microscope. These elements are moving and have a “life” inside them.\nh3.b-left: Non existant Order\np: Because, there is no creation of order and a lively organism combined by these living beings, constructed by humans; I am a believer. Robots formed, the cars on roads, moving machinery, are un-organised combinations of elements of periodic table.\np: These machineries do not rely on meats or vegetables. These are working in a life-less, boring, un-ordered fashion. These creations of humans need continuous maintenance to keep  running.\nh3.b-left: What does Allah want out of it from us?\np: Things, alive, in nature, do not need maintenance. <b>Allah wants us to see these organisms, act on the reality, prove Him you deserve to see Him, then may be we can ask to see Allah. </b>\np: This part only means, we discover Allah by getting dirty in the mud, by studying the periodic tables, gathering the knowledge of truth and then getting closer to the truth. Allah is asking us to become scientists, developers, philanthropists, writers and painters. No other way, you will near Allah. Nearing truth, is nearing Allah.\nh3.lavendar: 2. No arrogance\nimg: balance.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Balance by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@marcelo-moreira-988124 target=_blank>Marcelo Moreira</a>\np: As soon as you find Allah, you can not walk with arrogance. You can not take credit for a good blog, a good Website, a good presentation or a good Tesla car. You are already vulnerable. One element mis-hits the throat, enters the wind-pipe, you die.\np: We do not control any part of our life. The walk, movement of hand, tongue and eyes, are some elements of periodic table listening to us today. Any of the element disobeys me, I land in lands of misery, depression and hopelessness.\np: A scientist, a painter, a vlogger, a traveller, is not proud. If he is proud, then he has not neared Allah. He has not yet found Allah. He is still struggling and needs the push.\nh3.lavendar: 3. Praise Him\nimg: nature2.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Nature by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: He is not only pretty, colourful and amazing. He is also graceful, inspiring and motivating. He is a great leader. He holds your finger, walks you in your walker, pushes your cradle, gives you toys, a mother and friends. He brings you to your teenage-hood. Teaches you to play football, swing a racquet and throw a ball. He helps you learn to swim. In clouds, he lets you feel the wind. Gives you a pen. A book. A staff. A rank. He leads you to your today.\np: After all the effort by Him, you ask for another rank, another car, another bump and another push. You say, you do not live happy, because you hate your boss, parents or wife. When He tells you to thank Him, today, when He floated red, energetic blood in your veins, your respond with a complain.\nh3.b-left: Does He stop giving you while you sin, betray, complain and hurt?\np: No. 10 years down this road, He will give you children, better car, bigger house, stable children and new colors.\np: After 10 years, you will complain of your weaker legs, losing daughter or failing child. You will not have the bigger, more and new. You will wish for more.\np: He will still not stop. He will still hold your hands and will take you to your destination.\nh3.b-left: Allah is writing\np: While you can not see, the writer is writing a beautiful story. The artist is planning a beautiful day. The painter is designing the judgment day. When all hell will break loose. The complainers will look to their fellows. Betrayal, hopelessness and un-ending misery, will hurt you. If you will not stop complaining, and start thanking, you will lose more than you are losing today.\np: Be happy. You do not need anything, but a sketch book and some colors.\nh3.lavendar: 4. Prostrate to Allah\nimg: abudhabi.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Grand Mosque by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@manpritkalsi target=_blank>Manprit Kalsi</a>\np: This verse is a “sajda” ayat. Please spare a moment to submit to Allah. Hold on, think of Him around, inside and above, all in control. Submit to Him, and tell Him, your life is no more like the way as it is today. No more late waking up, complaining bad taste, or fighting the goodness. Just tell Him, you will start discovering Him starting today. You will not waste a minute, where you are not looking at Him, fearing Him and thanking Him.\np: Convince Him, you are better, beautiful and an honourable creation. Tell Him, you will not break promises. Promise Him, you will make Him proud. Love Him, for the cradle to the car standing outside in your porch.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: applestore.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Apple store by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: I have this iPhone 8, bought it 2 years back from Islamabad. I am so happy, I am writing this blog on a phone, made by a person I love so much. Steve Jobs. Such a great human being. A love-able person. Honest and colorful.\np: I know Steve Jobs has spread more Islam, more love and more Allah’s message, than most Pakistanis alive. I love him, for his talks on stage to his honesty towards poor.\np: Someday I will meet him and thank him for giving me an iPhone, where I can write a blog and share message of Quran to the world.\np: Be the Steve, exactly like him, creator of beautiful machines, spreader of positivity and marketer of honesty; Allah might forgive you. He might bring you closer and He might cure your world.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: Preparation for Ramadan\np.note: This topic is inspired by 11th Apr 2020 online session of <a href=https://www.dedicatedparents.com target=_blank>Dedicated Parents</a> by Dr Samia Raheel Qazi.\niframe: https://www.youtube.com/embed/BW-QxUy37hA\np.text-center.caption: Recording of Lecture on “Preparation for Ramadan”\np: <a href=https://www.dedicatedparents.com target=_blank>Dedicated parents</a> are a team of 4 x ladies who are currently running their business from their homes in Norway and Sweden. CEO Dr Mona Majeed is currently completing her Masters beside broadcasting routine weekly courses and lectures on zoom. The team members include her husband, relatives and friends. Total 4 team members, working day and night, bravely and committedly towards building bright homes for parents.\np: Dr Mona started walking this path in 2013 with the name of <b>Mothers' Group</b>. This project is intended to guide parents in upbringing their children according to teachings of Quran and Sunnah. They are conducting routine workshops, live seminars and webinars, that can be attended sitting at home. This program is one of these webinars.\np.b-left: 1. Who is Dr Samia\np.b-left: 2. The break down of the lecture\np.b-left: 3. Conclusion\nh3: 1. Who is Dr Samia\nimg.width-m-half: samiahtwitter.png\np.text-center.caption: Her twitter handle is <a href=https://twitter.com/srqazi target=_blank>@srqazi</a> and her website is <a href=http://www.jamaatwomen.org/ target=_blank>jamaatwomen.org</a>.\np: Dr Samia has been travelling and spreading the message of Quran around the globe for yeas. She has been striving hard to lit people's homes with bright Sunnah’s of Holy Prophet (PBUH).\np: After numerous lectures and tireless work, she is still learning and taking notes on Quran (as seen in the video). The moment she connects to Quran, she talks sober, brave and humble. Her talk above is proof of magic, Quran puts on its readers. It simply lights up your life with bright avenues.\nh3: 2. The break down of the lecture\np.note: The details of topics discussed in above lecture are attached below. I have listed important things “to do” for you with a symbol of “👉” under each drop down.\nbutton.collapse_all: Show All\ndropdownH: 1+ <span>12:34 - 15:59</span> <span>Dua of Musa (as)</span>\ndropdownF.img: 1+ <img src=/quranDailyImages/rabisharahli.jpg>\ndropdownF.quote: 1+ [Mosa (as)] said, \"My Lord, <b class=lavendar>expand for me my breast</b> [with assurance]. And <b class=lavendar>ease for me my task</b>. And <b class=lavendar>untie the knot</b> from my tongue. That they may<b class=lavendar> understand my speech</b>.”\ndropdownF: 1+ Recite this dua before every talk. We are weak. We have a breaking point. We are afraid of failures. We all are small inside our hearts. We need help. Just like Musa (as) felt weaker before facing the Firown, we all feel weak when we start taking bold steps. We need courage and the best door to seek this courage, is the <b>door of Allah</b>.\ndropdownF: 1+ 👉 Remember this Dua to your heart. Recite it every time you feel weak inside.\ndropdownH: 2+ <span>16:00 - 17:57</span> <span>Benefits of Social Media</span>\ndropdownF: 2+ I have been to different cities of the world. In America, Europe and Pakistan. Social media has made it possible for me to connect to people from different areas in minutes. Allah has made it easier for today’s muslims to spread the Islam to people across the world.\ndropdownF: 2+ 👉 Make consistent effort on spreading Quran. Use youtube, facebook, twitter, zoom, Microsoft teams and similar platforms.\ndropdownH: 3+ <span>17:58 - 20:49</span> <span>People of bright faces on judgement day</span>\ndropdownF.quote: 3+ There are people from the servants of Allah who are<b class=lavendar> neither prophets nor martyrs</b>; the <b class=lavendar>prophets and martyrs will envy them</b> on the Day of Resurrection for their rank from Allah, the Most High. They are people who <b class=lavendar>love one another for the spirit of Allah</b> (i.e. the Qur'an), <b class=lavendar>without having any mutual kinship</b> and <b class=lavendar>giving property to one</b>. I swear by Allah, <b class=lavendar>their faces will glow</b> and they will be<b class=lavendar> (sitting) in (pulpits of) light</b>. They will have <b class=lavendar>no fear (on the Day) when the people will have fear</b>, and <b class=lavendar>they will not grieve</b> when the people will grieve. <br> - Sunan Abi Dawud 3527\ndropdownF: 3+ These people are very simple, humble, neither martyrs nor prophets. They just love each other for the sake of Allah. Their hearts stay clean of jealousy. They walk blindly on the teachings of Allah.\ndropdownF: 3+ 👉 Pray before you sleep to Allah to make you rise with these people of lit faces on Judgment day.\ndropdownH: 4+ <span>20:50 - 21:45</span> <span>Fasting has been made mandatory</span>\ndropdownF.quote: 4+ O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed to (fard upon) you as it was prescribed to those before you, that <b class=lavendar>you may (learn) self-restraint</b>. <br> - Surah Al Baqarah verse 183\ndropdownF: 4+ Brothers and sisters, this month has the potential, ingredients and blessings, that will change your life. You want to quit smoking, become disciplined, succeed in profession, find a good wife or get wealthy; this month will make your life a success in 30 days.\ndropdownF: 4+ 👉 Make a commitment today and stay strong on it for next 40 days (until Ramadan ends).\ndropdownH: 5+ <span>21:46 - 24:34</span> <span>God Consciousness</span>\ndropdownF: 5+ Allah is around you. You have to talk to Him, to feel Him and discover Him. Look at Him out the window, in the Quran, in your nights, during the month of Ramadan. Feel Him beside you that you find courage.\ndropdownF.quote: 5+ The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, <b class=lavendar>a guidance for the people</b> and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So <b class=lavendar>whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it</b>; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. <b class=lavendar>Allah intends for you ease</b> and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and <b class=lavendar>to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you</b>; and perhaps <b class=lavendar>you will be grateful</b>.\ndropdownF: 5+ 👉 Be “grateful” for the Ramadan.\ndropdownH: 6+ <span>24:35 - 25:54</span> <span>The night of the Qadr</span>\ndropdownF.quote: 6+ Indeed, We sent the Qur'an down during the <b class=lavendar>Night of Power</b>. And what can make you know what is the Night of Power? The Night of Power is <b class=lavendar>better than a thousand months</b>. The <b class=lavendar>angels and the Spirit descend</b> therein by the permission of their Lord for every matter. <b class=lavendar>Peace it is</b> until the emergence of dawn. <br> - Surah Al Qadr.\ndropdownF: 6+ It did not happen until the Islam. Never were we blessed with a 1000 months in a single night. It is a blessing. Clear, visible and beautiful route to heaven. Pack your bags, put them in your boot, start your engine and drive down this road to Jannat Ul Firdous. Book your place next to Prophet (PBUH).\ndropdownF: 6+ 👉 Make a promise to yourself that you will stay up and connect to Allah through nawafils, recitations and duas these last odd nights of Ramadan.\ndropdownH: 7+ <span>25:55 - 28:49</span> <span>Health Benefits</span>\ndropdownF: 7+ Fasting is direly needed for a good health. Major 8 advantages of “fasting” according to science are listed below. <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>1</span> Improves your blood sugar control. </span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>2</span> Fights body’s swelling, irritations caused due to inflammations. </span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>3</span> Enhances Heart Health by Improving Blood Pressure, Triglycerides and Cholesterol Levels. </span> <br> <span class=w-50><span class=circle>4</span> Boosts Brain Function and Prevents Neurodegenerative Disorders. </span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>5</span> Aids Weight Loss by Limiting Calorie Intake and Boosting Metabolism. </span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>6</span> Increases Growth Hormone Secretion, Which Is Vital for Growth, Metabolism, Weight Loss and Muscle Strength. </span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>7</span> Could Delay Ageing and Extend Longevity. </span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>8</span> Aids in Cancer Prevention and Increases the Effectiveness of Chemotherapy.\ndropdownF.note: 7+ Dr Samia referred to scientific research, I felt it will be useful if I specifically mention the health benefits in this blog. You can check more on this article by <a href=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fasting-benefits#section7 target=_blank>Health Line’s website</a>.\ndropdownF: 7+ 👉 Take a screenshot of these 8 points and place them near you; phone, wall or pin it at the top of your social media account.\ndropdownH: 8+ <span>28:50 - 30:30</span> <span>Celebrate the Month of Ramadan</span>\ndropdownF: 8+ It is a festive for Satan is held in shackles, Angels are bringing in the news of wellness and Allah is <b class=lavendar>1. merciful</b>, <b class=lavendar>2. forgiving</b> and <b class=lavendar>3. protecting us from Hell fire</b>, Himself. It is when you stop following the satan and you take control of your movements. It is when you put your entire focus on becoming a source of happiness and joy.\ndropdownF: 8+ Just celebrate this month to your fullest. Walk with a smile on your face. Push the bad instincts, boring habits and dull addictions out of your life. Flush satan out. Find the real you, inside you.\ndropdownF: 8+ 👉 Give the good news of arrival of ramadan to one of your friend with a smile on your face. Text him, no problem.\ndropdownH: 10+ <span>31:10 - 35:49</span> <span>Pray to Allah</span>\ndropdownF: 10+ You need to<b class=lavendar> remind yourself of 3 x things</b> and supplicate. <br> <span class=circle>1</span> You wanted the doors to forgiveness and mercifulness open to you. You wanted the Pandemic to settle down. You wanted to see Kaaba open up and you were looking for a window where you could ask Allah for forgiveness. You wanted it all year and now it is approaching. <br> <span class=circle>2</span> You need to re-assure yourself Allah created your nails, hair, eye brows and taught you to walk without staff. He helped you play football. He gave you kids and a job. He loves you more than your mother, your father and your siblings. You just have to convince Him, you deserve His love. <br> <span class=circle>3</span> You know you have sinned. Lived a life of forgetfulness. Failed to walk the road of Quran and Sunnah. You know it was a bad life. You have to look at your sins. Embolden them. Hang them around your life and encircle them. Believe, you were a sinner. And you need Allah’s help to live the rest of your life on the path of Quran.\ndropdownF: 10+ 👉 Write down 3 x things where you want to succeed. Now pray to Allah, exactly, how you want to achieve them.\ndropdownH: 11+ <span>35:50 - 40:34</span> <span>Meaning of word “ila” in Kalma</span>\ndropdownF: 11+ Dr Samia explained the <b class=lavendar>meaning of word “ila” in 5 x parts</b>. <br> <span class=circle>1</span> You are not saved from harm, punishment or a test, unless Allah wants to save you from it. It is quite vulnerable to live a normal life, while you forget Allah. <br> <span class=circle>2</span> No one can save me from the on going pandemic. It is a mercy for a believer. If you die, submitting and humbled in front of Allah, there is a good life right after your death. Science, Technology and Super powers have kneeled in front of micro organisms, that have souls in them and are roaming on the orders of Allah. <br> <span class=circle>3</span> The earth is closed for cleaning. Earth is being healed by Allah himself. There were unlimited number of Climate Change campaigns, but no human effort has succeeded. The Allah is healing our planet. <br> <span class=circle>4</span> Calamities are not only pandemics or death. It is prevailing fear of loosing your wealth, reputation and children. It can be a mis-directed neutron in your brain. It can be a mosquito bringing you down from your throne to the threshold of your palace (Firown). Allah protects us. He is already protecting us. You need to have faith in His protection. <br> <span class=circle>5</span> Science, tech and advancements is bringing back the message of Quran. People are finding Allah once again. They are already looking towards Him for help. The athans in Europe to recitations in our mornings are bearing fruit. Humans are connecting to Allah because of Allah.\ndropdownF: 11+ 👉 Recite the kalma when you feel you are developing fear of loosing. Start putting your trust in Allah’s help.\ndropdownH: 12+ <span>40:35 - 41:24</span> <span>Five rights of Quran</span>\ndropdownF: 12+ Following are 5 x duties on every muslim towards Quran. <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>1</span> Have Faith in Allah.</span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>2</span> Recitation of Quran. </span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>3</span> Contemplate (Tadabbur).</span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>4</span> Act on Quran.</span> <br> <span class=w-50> <span class=circle>5</span> Share your wealth with those who are in need (Imlaak).</span>\ndropdownF: 12+ 👉 Give at least Rs 10 Sadaqah every day.\ndropdownH: 13+ <span>41:25 - 46:00</span> <span>Connect with Prophet (PBUH)</span>\ndropdownF.quote: 13+ A man asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment) saying, \"When will the Hour be?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What have you prepared for it?\" The man said, \"Nothing, except that I love Allah and His Apostle.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “<b class=lavendar>You will be with those whom you love.</b>“ <b class=lavendar>We had never been so glad</b> as we were on hearing that saying of the Prophet (i.e., \"You will be with those whom you love.\") Therefore, I love the Prophet, Abu Bakr and `Umar, and I hope that I will be with them because of my love for them though my deeds are not similar to theirs. <br> - Sahih al-Bukhari 3688\ndropdownF: 13+ We need to increase ourself in our Faith. We need to remind ourselves, we will meet Muhammad soon. We need to sketch his life by our hands. As we read him, we will become the people who love Prophet and we will feel glad of the news “We will be raised with Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)”.\ndropdownF: 13+ 👉 Read 1 page of life of Prophet (PBUH).\ndropdownH: 14+ <span>46:01 - 47:29</span> <span>Dedicated Parents</span>\ndropdownF: 14+ I am happy that you young daughters of Islam are spreading the message of Allah and teaching parents to raise good children.\ndropdownF: 14+ It is not easy to gather courage to design a flyer, few people and arrange a speaker. It needs strong nerves. Some fights and abundance of purpose. Dedicated Parents, being run by sister Mona Majeed, from Norway, is an example of honest intention of making parent’s life easier through Quran and Sunnah.\ndropdownF: 14+ 👉 Encourage one person you know, who is struggling in achieving his goals.\ndropdownH: 9+ <span>47:40 - 53:00</span> <span>Give Time to Family</span>\ndropdownF: 9+ Find 30 minutes in your day. Prepare a good presentation on your notebook or your laptop. Buy an HDMI Cable and connect the laptop to your TV. Make your family sit in front of the TV for these 30 Minutes. Deliver your lecture about Quran, a story from Prophets or a personal life lesson.\ndropdownF: 9+ This way you will create heroes of future from your own family. You will lead your house like Prophet Muhammad (saw) and Allah will provide you, for you, your legacy in your children.\ndropdownF: 9+ Read <a href=https://www.soundvision.com/article/reconnect-with-family-this-ramadan-in-20-minutes-or-less target=_blank>this article by Sound Vision</a> to find 20 x ways you can give time to your family in this Ramadan.\ndropdownF: 9+ 👉 List topics for 30 x days in your personal notebook before Ramadan.

Conclusion\nimg: bulb.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Bulb by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@fotografierende target=_blank>Fotografierende</a>\np: Take time out of your busy routine. Start going home early. Give time to your family. Bring discipline in your life. Sleep early. Rise early. Read Quran in the morning. Love your encounters. Act professional. Fulfil your promises. Keep a smile on your face. Cheer people up. Learn new skills. Create meaningful solutions. Live life to the fullest. It is a small life. In few years you will just leave. After 3 days, your nearest will forget you. Act in ways, people remember you, after you leave them. They try to live on your purpose. They spread your message. After you die you will be watching your children spreading your happiness. Make, talk, love and laugh. Just live your today like it is your last day.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

        "body": "h1: What is a business\np.note: How important is money in your business. Is it really money that runs a successful brand? Let’s discuss making your business come alive.\nimg: homeoffice.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Home office by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@kamo11235 target=_blank>Huseyn Kamaladdin</a>\np: Please understand the working of successful brands. They make count the minute details, give respect to weakest links and exploit the failures into their own advantages. Starters relying on excess of money, usually find it harder to run finances and maintain the delightful curvy graphs.\np: These 3 parts can fix your business. Not Money.\np.b-left: 1. Enjoy the Journey\np.b-left: 2. Take responsibility.\np.b-left: 3. Learn Deliberately\nh3.lavendar: 1. Enjoy the journey\nimg: journey.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Journey by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@nubikini target=_blank>Nubia Navarro</a>\np: The best part of zakatlists, techshek, easyheal, twinhub, dedicated parents, laurel home school and feed the poor is we are enjoying the journey. We have not yet reached there, a united Islam, a conquered Jerusalem, a great great gathering of Pakistanis, a huge hall to have a co working space with wonderful tech meetups. But we have travelled some miles towards our goals. People are discussing with us, talking our goals. We are line by line, sketching our goals to a reality. Some 3D Designs of Laurel Home School, some pinterest ideas converted into codes are coloring our life with amazing colors.\nh3.b-left: Count the Steps\np: The gravest problem with our goals is we are not counting the steps. We are looking ahead, far ahead into this space of un-ending ways our destination can end, and we are forgetting the number of steps we have walked down this road. Some days back, it was not a single step, just a bright excitement and no support. Some days back, some people were opposing us, ignoring us and thinking it is not possible. Few days back, just 3 months before, our meetups were not happening and were considered nothing but another “failed attempt” at bringing a positive change.\np: We are walking. We are enjoying. These walks down the patchy roads where we are being neglected, we are not forgetting the reasons we started. We have a hope and a path. Some where we are holding the Quran. Some how we are thanking Allah. We are spreading His message. And the byproduct? We are getting <b>rich</b> each passing day.\nh3.b-left: Ask yourself\nimg: dart.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Dart by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@enginakyurt target=_blank>Engin Akyurt</a>\nh5.b-left: Will we reach the destination?\np: Honestly, I don’t think we will. I know, this is a bad assumption. But it is soothingly re-affirming that it is <b>fine</b>, even if we fail. These steps are the important lessons from our struggles.\np: Do not forget it is just a “jump” that counts. When you die, your destination will be put in a beautiful envelop, brought and presented to you. If you struggle like you will die to achieve your goal, on death, you will get your goal.\nh3.b-left: Success after Death\np: Yes, it is kind of a boring explanation. What use is all the effort, if we can’t get to the destination in this life.\np: There is more to this life. You need to look at yourself. <b class=lavendar>You need to believe there is a life ahead</b>. You need to understand the unfathomable amount of effort put in to designing the clouds, the water drop, the touching the earth and the creation of life out of dead earth. You need to find the green of a tree, the blue of sky and the twist of your toe.\np: You need to get to the miracles in your life to understand, <b class=lavendar>you are blind</b>. New horizons, avenues, valleys, gardens, streams of water, talks of angels, metalled roads to Palaces and  generations awaiting you are around the corner. The death will take you to an amazing end that you will never forget, always love; where you will find the freedom.\nquote: Enjoy your <b class=lavendar>journey</b> to making your dream a reality.\nh3.lavendar: 2. Take responsibility\nimg: hat.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Hat by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@belart84 target=_blank>Artem Beliaikin</a> from Russia\np: You forget that each human being is a million tons of wonders happening right in front of you. This same human was once Muhammad, this same person was once Musa and this same person was once Adam. Each human being has a huge potential to make your business a success.\np: We forget and under estimate the opportunity that exists right in front of us. We want more likes, more followers and more people listening to us. We just forget that we needed to take the responsibility to bring the one person right in front of us to the same place where we ourself are standing today. We had to reach the pinnacle of leadership, where we create leaders of our kind.\nh3.b-left: One Person Matters\np: Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) made his companions \"leaders\" of his own kind. He raised Ali to fight at Khandak. Abu Bakr to donate all of his wealth. Umar to enter Jerusalem holding the rope of his servant’s ride. Khalid to stand fearless to Persia and Abu Ubaida standing his ground to the attacking plague.\np: Understand the important of every person you come across. Groom him, build him stronger, make him your investment. Do not give him money. Give him your love, honesty and energy. Prove him, you care. Convince him of your purpose. Make him the follower of same purpose as of yours. He alone will bring your brand forth and make it a success.\nh3.b-left: Take them on board\nimg: train.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Train by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: Take responsibility. People are important portions of your life. Take your wife, parents, siblings, friends on board. Make use of the people you already have around you. Tell them what you want to achieve. How you want to achieve. Where exactly do you need their support. Tell them to pat you on your back. Ask them to stand beside you, while you move forward. Do not give up on your relationships, friends and your goals.\np: As soon as the people around you, already present in your life, are standing on the same train as you are travelling upon, you move to your destination quicker. It all becomes just a journey. Lively, colorful, fun and one happy ride to a successful business.\nh3.b-left: Impact on <a href=https://www.meetup.com/techshek/ target=_blank>Techshek</a>\np: I have my wife as my co-organizer in organising these meetups. When you see my wife, beside me, me friends around me, you consider it an <b>honest</b> effort. It is given the credit. You attend it. We all take advantage out of it. I am thinking, discussing and designing standing in front of the house.\np: The train’s journey is already beautiful. I have my dream on a <b>white board</b> hanging on a wall in this house. All of home; the dishes in the kitchen, the meal in the refrigerator and the talks in the house, revolve around the reality of our goals. We are moving together towards making our dream a staunch reality.\nh3.b-left: Love your brand\nimg: lovebrand.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Brand by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@visual-tag-mx-1321732 target=_blank>Visual Tag MX</a>\np: You can not create a beautiful product, talk about it loud and confident, in front of your in-home people, <b class=lavendar>unless you love your product</b>. Have a love, a gratitude, some grace and an attitude, that spreads out of your personality. Make your brand a reflection of you. Be transparent, awkward, vulnerable and proud, that you make your brand a success.\nh3.lavendar: 3. Learn deliberately\nimg: hardwork2.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Work by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@olly target=_blank>Andrea Piacquadio</a>\np: “Learn deliberately” is another word for “do the hard-work”. You will get bored, tired and broken. But do not stop. Do not succeed. Do not create a good product. <b class=lavendar>Just create something useless, stupid and flawed. But “create”.</b>\np: Most brands fail, because they can’t survive the attacks, critiques and boring suggestions. Your brand does not need any new suggestion or a million dollar advice. It only needs you. It is already unique, an amazing idea and a great product. It is just you, who has to believe in your brand. Like “Nestle” is selling water, “Psychologists” are selling thoughts and “Doctors” are selling most of what is available on google. You can also sell your brand.\nh3.b-left: I am Failing\np: Yes you have been failing for past 3 years. You did not find the money. You did not get to the destination. Still struggling with putting food on table. Today, when you look back, you see only thuds and pits. May be one or two rise but you only see failures.\np: You are looking at “Money”, “Luxury” and “Comfort”. You are weighing success of your brand against the ease it has brought to your life. You have the wrong weighing scale, broken balance and wrong meaning of success.\np: You have travelled on a roller coaster of peaks, narrow valleys and deep oceans. You did not find the adrenaline rush. You were not loving the ride. You were not counting the steps. You were giving up because the world was telling you, you are failing. And you too mistakenly told yourself, “Yes I am failing”.\nh3.b-left: Purpose and Brand\nimg: purpose.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Finding Purpose by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@bongkarn-thanyakij-683719 target=_blank>Bongkarn Thanyakij</a>\np: Hard work if not fruitful and if it drags you from reaching the purpose of your life, it is not hard work. It is called <b>useless work</b>. Soon you will give up on “working hard”.\np: You want to paint the goal and the purpose linked to the goal on a piece of paper. The purpose has to be based on truth. It can be “<b>I will speak to 1 Million people on stage one day</b>” but it can not be “<b>I will drive Lamborghini</b>”. Stage and people are purpose. Lamborghini is a <b>polluted thought</b>, but a <b>byproduct</b> of your efforts in achieving your true purpose.\nh3.b-left: Purpose is Truth\nquote: Give your brand a purpose basing upon truth, honesty and loyalty. Try to embrace this purpose. Start working deliberately towards achieving it.\nh3.lavendar: Conclusion\nimg: zakatlists.png\np.text-center.caption: Home page of <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/ target=_blank>zakatlists.com</a>\np: I can not live with out looking at the photo of zakatlists.com every day. I can not read Quran, give time to my family, perform good at office and talk loud with friends, when I miss out the “thinking” of my purpose. I am deep into making it a success. I am throwing my money, time and reputation into making this brand a reality. I am a happy web developer, a passionate writer and a crazy lover. I am an artist. I am just me, because this purpose completes me.\nh5: Your friends are taking it light? Your family is ignoring it? Your colleagues are making fun? People are laughing at you?\np: This is a “sign”, you are going on the right path. When they make fun of you, laugh with them. Make fun of yourself. When they attack you, dive deep into the valley of despair, with them. When they talk “failure”, talk the best failures. Ride their tone. Love their criticism. Make fun of yourself, standing beside them.\nh3.b-left: Dream Big\np: If you have a purpose, you believe in, you can not fail in your life. <b class=lavendar>Your present is already one bright day</b>. You are already riding the train, crossing the tunnels, sitting in its coffee lounge, reading the magazine and thinking, this one bold letter on the left top of this page, will give a better design if placed on the left top of your brand’s website or your blog or the mega structure you want to build one day in the centre of the city.\np.note: Guys, if you like this project.

The mystical sun set and some magical horizon.\nimg: ocean.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Ocean by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@sebastian target=_blank>Sebastian Voortman</a>\np: This is what I want. Personally, I would prefer cruising the ocean than sitting in a boring room. Away. Deep into crushing waves of un-ending breeze, noisy waters and droplets touching my face. I just want to get out and sail the seas.\np: But in lockdown, I can only imagine, the sail, ship and noise. Let’s put our imagination to words.\np.b-left: 1. The island\np.b-left: 2. Sharks\np.b-left: 3. Dive\nh3: 1. The island\nimg.width-m-half: island.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Island by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@ollivves target=_blank>Oliver Sjöström</a>\np: The island is covered with white sand, green trees, a small hut, some fire wood, a coffee beans jar, isolated from world, deep into the sees. This photo is my favourite place right now. I want to cruise here on a speed boat. Sit here and read the book. Find the truth. Look at the birds. Listen to the chirp. Observe an ant and paint the horizon. I want to learn to live on my own. Not dependant but brave and courageous like a traveller. I want to \"Trust my instincts\".\np: Do not hop here longer. 2 Days. A week. Some more days here. It is freedom. Your take hold of the pen to design your life. Live your life. Get out and trust your instincts. Find the island. Take hold of the steering of your boat and MOVE. Ride. Love. Because Prophet (PBUH) said;\nquote: A Bedouin asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about the emigration. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, \"May Allah have mercy on you! The matter of emigration is very hard. Have you got camels? Do you pay their Zakat?\" The Bedouin said, \"Yes, I have camels and I pay their Zakat.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, <b class=lavendar>Work beyond the seas and Allah will not decrease (waste) any of your good deeds</b>.” <br> - Sahih al-Bukhari 1452\np: Prohet (PBUH) tells you to follow your dream. Live your life to the fullest. Enjoy every second of your journey to your goals. You are guaranteed wealth. Your income will not lower. You will succeed.\nh3: 2. Sharks\nimg: sharks.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sharks by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@mudmanuk target=_blank>Paul Carroll</a>\np: The blue waters, the grey texture, and black eyes. Some small wings and a moving tail. The jump and smile on its face. It makes me wonder, what went into her head. Where was it a moment before. Deep into the ocean. With some fellows. Struggling to find the meal. Cruising to hunt. Capture, eat and cheer.\np: The shark and the whale and all the fishes deep under this water, are living, hunting and getting their meals. Born fighters, fighting every minute. Learning every second. Living each micro-second.\np: Live your life like a shark. Hunt your target. Rely on God. Find the meaning of your life. Live the truth. Die like you got all the wealth, livelihood and adventure. You gathered everything you have dreamt in your life.\nquote: The Prophet [SAW] said:- \"Whoever fights to protect his wealth and is killed, he is a martyr. Whoever fights to protect himself, he is a martyr. Whoever fights to protect his family is a martyr.\" <br> - Sunan an-Nasa'i 4094\np: This hadith tells you to protect your tribe, message, dignity and mission just like a shark. You die, you die a martyr. A martyr is not dead, literally alive.\nh3: 3. Dive\nimg: dive.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Dive by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@christoffere target=_blank>Christoffer Engström</a>\np: Feel the water touching your back, the green beside the water and the mist at horizon. It is not a photo. It is a life. The movement of water. It hitting you. Refreshing you. Purifying you. It is adventure. Cruising the ocean. Living on an island. Hunting the meal and building a momentum. This is how you live life.\np: The dull moving fan, same old views, one bed all your life, is no more there in your life. You are all on your own. Finding the truth. Embracing and Living it. <b class=>Life is everything you will find in heaven</b>.\nquote: The Prophet (ﷺ) used to take care of us in preaching by selecting a suitable time, so that we might not get bored. (He abstained from pestering us with sermons and knowledge all the time). <br> - Sahih al-Bukhari 68\np: Prophet (PBUH) lead his companions, with adventure, passion and purpose. Dive into finding the truth. Dive like it is your goal of life. Start sharing photos of your travels, dives and jumps. People will near you. Ask you. Talk to you. They will not get bored with your boring sermons and all time knowledge talks. They will love your dives. They will want to live your life.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: sail.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sail by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@bobbyburchphotography target=_blank>Bobby Burch</a>\np: The sail in above photo is a work of art done over hundreds of years. Some among them were <b>carpenters</b>, some <b>sew </b>the cloth, some <b>calculated impact of wind</b> on the curtains, some <b>studied gravity</b>, <b>effect of moon </b>and some <b>researched the waters</>. Some humans have put a significant amount of time into making our today a reality.\np: Please guys, honor these scientists and skilled workers. Live your life that you further the struggles of these carpenters and tailors. Make your life skilful. Pick a course on <a href=https://www.udemy.com target=_blank>udemy</a>. Get to making videos, designing websites, pinning nails, cutting woods and creating the hardware. You can make a beautiful home automation system where you clap and lights turn on.

Or you can <a href=https://www.twitter.com/laurelhomescho1 target=_blank>build a school for children of your village</a>. You can also contribute, after you MOVE.

Today’s blog will teach you how you can write one and make it stand out.\nimg: blogging1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Blog by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\nh3.brown: Advantages of writing blogs\np: Before we move to “how” you can start writing, let me tell you “why” you should start writing.\np: <span class=circle>1</span>  It builds your <b class=lavendar>sentence construction</b>. If you find a lag in your routine communication. You should start writing. It will build an amazing library of words. It will also boost you confidence to let you win your everyday encounters.\np: <span class=circle>2</span> Blog writing <b class=lavendar>organises your thoughts</b>. You want to reach to <b>conclusions</b> of your every day experiences. You can not create meaningful conclusions unless you ponder over them. Blogs let you think about your assumptions. It gives a structure to your imagination. It validates your goals.\np: <span class=circle>3</span> Blog is your “go to\" place to <b class=lavendar>market your product</b>. If you want to sell a subscribe button, you will need to explain it to people. If you want to sell a cookie, you need to put its design out there with its recipe. If you want to sell your website, you need to write its story. If you want to lead people, you need to put yourself into words. It is a place for every one, because every one of us is selling something.\nh3.brown: How to write a good blog\nimg: colors.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Colors by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@steve target=_blank>Steve Johnson</a>\np: A blog has following major parts.\np.b-left: 1. Content\np.b-left: 2. Your Personality\np.b-left: 3. Sincerity\np.note: I am assuming you are serious about writing blogs, that is how you have reached this far. Please pen down these points. Because in 3 days this blog will go premium and you will not be able to access it. Also I am available, in case you need help or review on your written content. Just DM me on twitter. I will be really happy to read and review your content. Link is attached at the bottom of this post.\nh3: <span class=circle>1</span> Content\nh3.b-left: Break your article into sub headings.\nimg.border.border-round: subhdg.png\np.text-center.caption: Above is the breakdown of this blog. I wrote it prior to writing this blog.\np: It is also called as “Brain Storming”. This technique is used in “Documentation Construction” of softwares. Here you only pen down the parts that come to your mind. After you have listed all the parts of your talk, sort them and reach to a conclusion.\np: The breaking into sub-headings and listing them, also gives you a peace of mind. You realise you have all important content right in front of you. Your thoughts start aligning with these headings. You evaluate and finally gather courage to start writing.\nh3.b-left: Talk\nimg: sitstage.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Stage by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@bertellifotografia target=_blank>Matheus Bertelli</a>\np: You need to put yourself in the shoes of a <b>better yourself</b>. You are sitting on a stage. Your laptop is open next to you. Your audience is sitting right in front of you. You have an ample amount of thoughts that you want go heard and understood. You are prepared and ready to speak.\np: Elaborate each part of your “brain stormed” breakdown into sentences. They can be long. Some sentences can get boring. But try to write paragraphs in one motion. Focus on 1 message in each paragraph.\nh3.b-left: Give Value\np: Your readers are valuable audience. You do not want to waste their time. You do not want they listen to you and get bored. You also do not want they misunderstand your message.\np: For that, assume you are sitting on stage and there is only 1 person in front of you. You will find it hard to give value to a single person looking at you. If you succeed in giving value to 1 person on stage, you will succeed in delivering your message across to your individual reader.\np: Take responsibility of producing meaningful content.\nh3: <span class=circle>3</span> Your Personality\nimg: personality.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Personality by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@bongkarn-thanyakij-683719 target=_blank>bongkarn thanyakij</a>\nh3.b-left: Pictures\np: The above picture is a reflection of my work space. I want a cup of tea, my phone, laptop and diary right in front of me, while I am developing / writing blogs.\np: Similarly, you have to find pictures that reflect your better self. You need to place these pictures in front of you to get a better hint at how you are going to write about them.\np: Add good, colorful and meaningful pictures to your blogs. Pictures gives your blog variation of colors. A reader, does not want to read your entire blog. He is in want of finding content specific to his interest. Pictures does just that, give interest.\nh3.b-left: Font Style\nimg: roboto.png\np.text-center.caption: Roboto by <a href=https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto target=_blank>Google</a>\np: I use Roboto in my blogs. It is readerly. Gives book like look. With grey color and lighter black, the headings and paragraph do not over-run the content.\np: You need to chose subtle font style, small variation of colors. If you are going with black, it is a real bold step. I would suggest you stop, increase the transparency of black. Lower down the tone of your font. Do not use bold colors, unless you have a bold personality.\np: Personally, I like humble and calm people more than bold and clever people.\nh3.b-left: Construct Small Sentences\np: Do not write lengthy sentences. To the point. On Spot. Blunt and Focused. There is no need to follow Grammar and boring rules. Spread your message like you are in control of your content. Plain. Simple and Meaningful. Do not use difficult words,  lengthy paragraphs and Mono colored essays.\np: Sentence construction is like poetry. It resonates with your previous words. If you break the motion of creating short, beautiful and interlinked words, you literally loose your reader.\nh3.b-left: Where should you publish?\nimg: 9bestblogging.png\np.text-center.caption: <a href=https://themeisle.com/blog/best-free-blogging-sites/ target=_blank>Article</a> on 9 best free blogging sites by Themeisle.\np: You do not need to create everything from scratch. You do not need to be a web developer. You do not need to be a tech geek. It is 2020, you can publish your blog post just in a click.\np: I have used <a href=https://medium.com/ target=_blank>Medium.com</a> for nearly 1 year. It is a carefully designed and thoroughly delivered, platform, for beginners as well as experts. If you write consistently, it will let you earn through blogs.\np: If you want to opt for another platform, you should read <a href=https://themeisle.com/blog/best-free-blogging-sites/ target=_blank>this blog</a> by Themeisle.\nh3: <span class=circle>3</span> Sincerity\nimg: sincerity.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sincere by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@kylejglenn target=_blank>Kyle Glenn</a>\nh3.b-left: Write Consistently\np: You can not succeed, unless you work on reaching your goals everyday. It is that simple and straight. You can not work on your goals everyday, unless you love your destination. You can not love your destination, unless you have a good imagination power.\np: Draw your destination on a good white paper. Hang it on your biggest wall. And start writing about it everyday. Until you achieve, what you desire to achieve.\np: Soon you will see “the law of attraction” becoming true. Your surroundings will start turning into your kind of people, your furniture and house will be on a similar island, that you dream about. Soon you will reach your destination.\np: Work hard, write everyday, publish consistently and succeed.\nh3.b-left: Put your content in 2 boxes; Love and Respect\nimg: divide.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Divide by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@worthyofelegance target=_blank>Alex</a>\np: Once you start writing consistently, you will find people losing interest in your content. It is a natural instinct. But while the interest is decreasing, audience is leaving, leaves are breaking, you are becoming a poet, artist and a leader. Your thoughts will lead your affairs in your home, friends’ circle and at your job.\np: Meanwhile, you will need to make your content premium.\np: Love your recently published blog. Let it out in open. Talk about it. Spread its meaning. As it gets old, 2 or 3 blogs down in the shelf, respect it. Place it in a cabinet. Lock the drawer. Put a premium price on it. That way you will find people, loving your today’s content and respecting your older content.\nh3.b-left: Super impose your content with the purpose of your life\nimg: purpose1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Purpose by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@jamie452 target=_blank>Jamie Street</a>\np: The easiest part of pouring in your personality is you “identify” your aim of life. You create a “product” out of it. And when it is time, to launch the product, start writing. Without purpose, you can not make your content sing. It needs to resonate with your actions. It has to show your downs, struggles, failures and sweat ridden body.\np: Yet, there is nothing that should stop you from writing. If you want to become a great writer, that writes the best books in the world, you should start writing today.\np: There is no short cut to success. You are talented, beautiful and an amazing human being. You used to undermine your potential. But believe me, you are not less than Stephen King or William Shakespeare. You have exactly same amount of blessings of Allah as these people had. The only difference between you and Charles Dickens is; he reached the pinnacle of writing great books. And you are just starting.\nh3.lavendar: Conclusion\nimg: blogger.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Blogger by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@canvastudio target=_blank>Canva Studio</a>\np: Cosy up a little.

All children in the world are selfless, kind hearted and energetic.\np: The moment we enter schools with less lively, poverty ridden fellows and instructors, we embrace impurity. We start running after stupid medals and useless certificates.\np: A pile of useless certificates with low self esteem, strong lust for wealth, further pollutes our minds.\np: The dive into the sea of short lived success, took us further away from truth. We forgot childhood’s Life. We failed to laugh. We became enslaved to a boss.

Pakistan stood victorious.\np: An entire ummah moved across. Corruption dominated us. We fought on “which party” to rule the parliament. Confusions were in the air. We tried too hard to fix.

We were not prepared. <b class=lavendar>10 years</b> in a row, we were surprised. We did not lose life. We gained more will, resolve and mettle to die for this sand.\np: Suicide attacks, propaganda warfare, corruption and honor killings were all there. Still here. But there is no harm done to Pakistan. The land is still growing and spreading. Its people of good hearts are building vaccines, running charities and helping suppressed across the globe.\np: Believe me, it is not India. It is not Jerusalem. It is not Hypocrisy. It is truth. Quran is read aloud in mosques, homes and streets. Rapists do not brag. Murderers do not take pride. Filth doesn’t survive. This land, Pakistan, is home to Allah’s message.\nh3.b-left: The Good Thing\np: An army is preparing itself. Cantonments are being built.

Forget UN speach because that is just a speach. Forget Kartarpur Sikh Pilgrims Rahdari. Did he not return Abhinandan and you opposed him? Did he not act like Prophet and you humiliated him?\np: Truth wins. It is that simple. Pakistani PM speaks truth, it will rise. Not a dot of a doubt. Not a question. Not sanity and logic. Pakistan is Rising.\np: Some more opposition and logic will stop us from believing. Some more anchors will give us saner reasons.

Finding Opportunity through Quran\np.b-left: 2. Smile\nh3.lavendar: 1. Finding the Opportunity through Quran\np: You had enough of this cycle. Same old faces. Same door and trees. Nothing is new and it could not get more dull. It is time to take a turn, the step, to get out and LIVE.\np: Open your shelf. Take out Quran. Read a verse. Two if you want. Pen down its summary. Find out its meaning. Connect the dots. The reasoning and logic. Find the amusement. Reach the truthful meaning. And sit back. Take support of the back of your sofa. And think.\np: uffh. I missed so much wealth, happiness and tears. So much needed a fix, and I didn’t give it a try.\np: Think. Stop there. Shut your brain. Look deep into your soul. Inside you, it is a miraculous giant. Infinite microbes connected, beating and running. Heart racing. Neurones flashing. A universe, inside you, wanted you to Live. And You did not Live.\np: Let‘s take the U turn. Change the ride. Drive on the new road. Run opposite. Head lowered and heart pumping. Do not get tired. Do not stop. Do not Fail no more. This time break the wall. This time, convince your Lord, you deserve the money, the house, the kids and a Life.\np: Quran, Allah, Micro organisms, hair, blood and you, the soul, are connected. Wired together. You are incomplete without the nature. Sun light gives your micro organisms vitamins, gives you White Blood Cells, gives you immunity, gives you courage, gives you Paradise.\np: Don’t you want it? The Life today? Tomorrow? Till you die? Don’t you want to jump out of a plane in Dubai? Don’t you want to race the deserts? Don’t you want a free Palestine and a free Yemen? Don’t you want Allah loves you?\np: Make your Nabi proud, today! Open Quran. Take the U turn. Bow your head down. Say your 2 nafal. And Run.\nh3.lavendar: 2. Smile\np: This part, find the hidden colors dug underneath the Struggle / Run / Spreading Quran.\np: You know, there is addiction to pleasure. Where you find a buzz, then you lose it. With it you lose confidence, motivation and happiness.\np: The struggle of spreading Quran, is the same buzz “amplified”. Today it is one difficult step. Tomorrow it is 100 steps, difficult. Day after tomorrow, it is a run. You stop keeping count of the steps. You stop looking at the distance you have covered. You do not look back. That tasty, this book of Quran, is.\np: Do you want a staff in your hand, and a glowing hand? Do you want a carpet that flies you around? Do you want a guardian standing beside you, powerful and beautiful?\np: As you read Quran, you stop thinking money, promotion and future. You just get out of this world. No more gravity, wind and struggle. It is simply meaningless. The next step under your foot, is multiplied a 1000 steps in your life. You wanted a car? You get one in days. You wanted an iMac? You get two in days. You wanted stability in your life? You get one in seconds. You wanted anything fast? You get it faster.\np: Stop thinking bro. You know I mean it. If you love travelling. Travel. If you love painting. Paint. If you love coding. Code. If you love freedom. Jump. Do not think now. Not one thought. Open the Quran. Take the U turn. Run and don’t stop.\nh3: Conclusion\np: This is short cut. Easy route. Lesser time. More than expected. It is quickly reaching your goal. Miraculously protected. Shielded from negativity. Rising in respect and love. A smooth journey to the real success.\np: Another important aspect of this route is, “<b>There is no satan here</b>”. You are not distracted by Porn, Loud Music and Lies. Your car, on this highway, is pumped to rush. No traffic. No speed bumps. No stops. On this highway, straight to the Success. ",

Let me tell you, Quran unites, not actions, decorated speeches and hard work, but “<b>identifying true friends</b>” [Surah Al Anfal <b>Verse 72</b>].\nimg: sky.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sky by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: We get humble, modest and respectful, when we are presented a gift. We try to connect to people who favour us. Our actions are dependant on the reactions. We foresee before hand, we re-assure ourself, we think before we take smaller actions. The movement of tongue to buying a new car are decisions, dependant on our foresighted repercussions.\np: Taking these measures of practicing extreme caution, at times lead us to fights / conflicts and disputes. We resort to distancing ourselves. We label the opponent an enemy of our satisfaction. We put our enemy into that farthest box, that hardly comes across in our life. We do not open it and we let it rot, till our deaths.\np: The verse 72 of Quran, provides a unique lesson, to identifying friends from foes.\nquote: Indeed, those who have <b class=brown>believed</b> and <b class=brown>emigrated</b> and <b class=brown>fought</b> with their wealth and lives in the <b class=brown>cause of Allah</b> and those who <b class=brown>gave shelter and aided</b> - they are allies of one another. But those who believed and did not emigrate - for you <b class=lavendar>there is no guardianship of them until they emigrate</b>. And if they seek help of you for the religion, then <b class=brown>you must help, except against a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty</b>. And Allah is Seeing of what you do. <br> - Surah Al Anfal Vesre 72\np: Quran is a beautiful book. I just highlighted the text with brown colors. I realised it unites Hindus, Jews, Christians, Athiests and Muslims. Not only them, it unites people collectively.\np: Today’s topic is broken into three parts:-\np.b-left: 1. Common Grounds of Unity\np.b-left: 2. One Important Lesson\np.b-left: 3. Broader Sense of Quran\nh3: 1. Common Grounds of Unity\np: Let’s break down the parts of the above verse,\np: <span class=circle>1</span> People who have believed, emigrated, fought, poured their wealth, sacrificed their Life in the way of Allah are your friends.\np: <span class=circle>2</span> People who have helped you in the cause of Allah, provided you shelter and aided you, they are your friends.\np: <span class=circle>3</span> People who did not emigrate, in spite of their submission to Islam, are not your friends until they emigrate.\np: <span class=circle>4</span> People who are from other religions, and they approach you for help, you help them.\np: <span class=circle>5</span> Do not violate the treaty.\nh3: 2. One Important Lesson\np: This verse is the uniting point of every single human being. Quran was not intended for a specific audience. It does not talk to just muslims. It talks to all the people of good hearts.\np: The verse speaks volumes of practicing \"honourable dealings\". It does not let us hurt people who have spoken truth in the shape of “Kalma” or people who have honored their “Treaty”.\np: The only lesson from the verse is “Unite” with each other. Find Good People around you. Be friend with them. Find people hurt you. Do not hate / punish / isolate them. Find Hindus who speak truth, give them priority. Find jews honouring a contract, do not fight with them.\np: You find a person betrayed, sinned, detracted, do not hurt him. Do you own catharsis, build yourself as a better human being, build a community of honest people around you, now fight the wrongs collectively. Still do not pick the shovel / the sword or your voice. Fight with wisdom that people of good hearts love you.\nh3: 3. Broader Sense of Quran\np: One can not find ways, justifications and words that are as smooth, calm and concrete as Quran. It is not possible we find solutions to our problems. It is also not possible we are able to justify other people's actions. We can not convince people of our honest intentions with our own words. Our words are deviated, dis integrated, filled with pauses and lack the confidence.\np: In the imperfection, there is only one perfect book / principle / style of life. Where you speak truth. You stand for honestly, alone, like a man. You protect people of true hearts. You fight evil. You act like Quran wants you to act. Then, you will be able to understand its meanings. Only then you will not spread violence. But peace, happiness and courage. Only after you hold tight to Quran, you will be able to live a life of Prophet (PBUH).\nh3: Conclusion\np: 4 months back, I was hustling. Today, I am writing 109th blog. Tomorrow it is 110th. I failed to convince few of my close friends, colleagues and relatives. But the miraculous part, I did not lose 1 friend, 1 colleague or a relative. I did not lose 1 penny. I did not lose a single Life Value. I doubted my dream number of times, but did not miss 1 patch. I did not lose.\np: This book is not violence, boring, stupidity or extremism. If you can read Urdu, English, Hindi and Arabic, you can read this book too. It asks of bringing in the discipline to our lives. It asks of writing blogs, travelling and creating freedom. It provides grounds where you need lesser hard work, lesser focus and lesser noise. It creates people of the kinds of Imran Khan, Quaid e Azam, Allama Iqbal. It created Muhammad. It, the speck in the entire universe, created the universe.",

Let us analyse Surah Toba (beginning verses 1 - 12) and understand the True Islam.\nimg: nabwi.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Prophet’s Mosque by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@konevi target=_blank>Konevi</a>\nh3: Revelation of Surah Toba\np: Surah Al Toba was revealed in the last span of Prophet’s life. Muslims had struggled for nearly 22 years and fought numerous battles to finally conquer Mecca. The enemies were running from the punishment. It was a time of sheer confusion. Quran was needed to fix the situation. Surah Al Toba was revealed to Prophet PBUH. It gave concise instructions to handle the situation.\np: As Islam stood victorious, there was almost no resistance. A small group of riders tried to intervene the approach towards Mecca, but they were too small to stop the momentum.\nh3: Forgiveness of Enemies\np: In year 630, Muhammad conquered Mecca. The arch enemies of Islam were forgiven. People were guaranteed protection if they followed these instructions.\np.b-left: 1. Stay inside your homes\np.b-left: 2. Try to take a place in Kaaba / Mosque\np.b-left: 3. Do not retaliate\np.b-left: 4. If you want to leave you are allowed to leave\np.b-left: 5. Take protection of a Muslim\nh3: The chaos in Mecca\nimg: mecca2.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Mecca by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@avanderweijst target=_blank>Anton van der Weijst</a>\np: It was chaotic at this point of time. The fear of death was shadowing Quraysh. In panic some were running to save themselves and some were hiding. Staunch enemies had committed war crimes, Ikram (ra) had hung two muslim captives and stoned them to death in public, were fearing death at the hands of Muslims.\np: In these times, Quran settled the situation appropriately.\nh3: Misinterpretation of Quran\np: There are some verses from Quran that are repeatedly shared with people to promote violence, hatred and rigidity. These verses were also used in the recent insurgency in Pakistan. People in ISIS are being trained to violence using these same verses of Surah Al Toba.\np: However, at the times of revelation of these verses of Quran, there was no act of violence. People found peace, inspiration and guidance through these verses.\nh3: Impact of deviating from the Truth\nimg: horses.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Horses by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@daniilvnoutchkov target=_blank>Daniil Vnoutchkov</a>\np: From this point onward Islam spread like fire in the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa. But when there was a deviation from truth; a significant amount of luxury, divide between poor and rich dominated, in 1258, Halaku Khan attacked Baghdad. Some more years down this road, we lost Ottoman empire. And in few years, we lost Sub Continent. As soon as we stopped following the principles based on equality, honesty and purity, we started disintegrating.\np: Lack of involvement in major research fields, discoveries and bold initiatives has ultimately dulled down the true colours of our religion. Quran is taken as a dull book. We do not value the life of Prophet (PBUH). Our relationships are getting weaker each passing day. Such lacking of creativity is further hurting our roots.\nh3: Laid Down Steps before Violence in Quran\np: Below is the break down of first 6 x Verses of Surah Toba with a summary of verse no 12.\nh3.b-left: Vesre 1. Declaration of disassociation.\np: A treaty called “Hudaybia” was signed between Qurayash and Muslims 2 years prior to the conquest of Mecca; tribes who will bind themselves with either Qurayash or Muslims, will be protected by their ally.\np: In spite of the agreement between Quraysh and Muslims, people of Quraysh helped / sponsored an attack on a muslim ally. In year 8 AH, Banu Bakr (ally of Quraysh) attacked Banu Khuza’a (ally of Muslims) with the backings of Quraysh. This verse is pointing to the breaking of terms by people of Quraysh.\nh3.b-left: Verse 2. 4 x Months of Free Time.\np: Muslims have captured Mecca. The panic is high in the air. Quraysh is running for their life. Quran directs Prophet (PBUH) to give 4 x Months of time to people of Quraysh. Do not kill or spread violence.\nh3.b-left: Verse 3. Warn the defeated army of Quraysh.\np: Prophet (PBUH) is directed to warn the people of Quraysh. Despite being in strength, the Muslims are being directed to only “warn” the disbelievers of Quran of a severe punishment in here-after.\np: It is a humbling attitude of an army. After the victory, victorious army does not bank on “warning” captives / criminals. Winning army either “imprisons” or “kills” the criminals. Muslims, the winning army, is however told to stay polite, sober and respectful while they are asking the criminals to <b class=lavendar>”Repent, that is best for you”</b> [snippet from verse 3].\nh3.b-left: Verse 4. Do not punish people who stayed true to the Pact.\nquote: <b class=brown>Excepted are those</b> with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything or <b class=brown>supported anyone against you</b>; so complete for them their treaty until their term [has ended]. Indeed, <b class=brown>Allah loves the righteous [who fear Him]</b>. <br> - Surah Al Toba verse 4\nh3.b-left: Verse 5. Do not punish in sacred Months.\np: [Sacred months are 1,7,11,12] The conquest of Mecca happened on 17th Ramadan (9th Month), according to Ibn Ishaq. While the Muslims were angry and wanted to take the revenge, Quran talks of avoiding violence.\nh3.b-left: Verse 6. Grant Protection to people who approach you for help.\np: People after they sin, hurt and disgust you. Those who break the covenant. Some who are war criminals. Once they reach out to you for help, you give them protection, you drop them at a place of safety. You ensure, the lives of people are protected if they humble towards you. You inspire them while they seek safety through verses of Quran, your actions and positivity.\np: You do not drag them down of their misery, humiliate them due to their weakness or punish them for their crimes before they sought your protection.\np: You simply become a good news for people who humble down and reach you for help.\nh3.b-left: Verse 12. Fight the disbelievers\np: Do not fight the people of other religions unless they attack you. Do not fight unless they break the established contracts. Do not snub any body’s freedom. Do not hurt them. Do not promote violence. Do not live an abnormal life where you are just hitting the wall every day of your life. Do not deviate from the Right path. Do not!\nh3: Islam promotes Peace\nimg: delhi.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Delhi by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@digitalbuggu target=_blank>Digital Buggu</a>\np: If you were told Islam promoted violence. You were told wrong. It does not promote violence. It promotes peace, forgiveness and harmony. There are only a handful of cases in the life of Prophet PBUH where the hands of “declared thieves” were amputated.\np: And there are slaves who were protected from the wrath of the riches. There were daughters being buried alive, Islam protected them. There were people of peace who were blindly attacked, Islam built a boundary around them. There were war criminals among Quraysh, like Ikrama, Islam made them a General in its Army. There was Khalid, who defeated Muslims in Khandak, Islam made him its Chief of Army Staff to fight Romans, Persians and Yarmouk.\np: Do not look at two punishments. Look at the captives who were liberated from prison cells because they could teach. Look at Muhammad, while he struggled for 13 years and found only 40 people who would accompany him till death.\np: If you see around you, in history, you will not find more revolutionary leader than Muhammad. He was a human being. He worked harder, selflessly and productively to convince people there is more to this life.\np: Islam is not violence. It is only what Muhammad did in 8 AH after the conquest of Mecca; the forgiving, free passage and freedom for captives. It is what Surah Toba says in first 12 verses of Quran; hold on. Hindus are your brothers, just wait for the time, Christians are your buddies, just hold on, Jews are your friends, hold. Wait. Unite. Because this is Islam.",

And most sentences in Quran are not explainable without years of research.\nimg: blacknwhite.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Black and White by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@jan-kroon-357445 target=_blank>Jan Kroon</a>\np: A famous quote / translation of Iqbal’s poetry.\nquote: Do not wait for Mehdi.

We believe it needs a tremendous amount of <b>research</b>, thorough clarity of <b>revelation circumstances</b> and <b>in depth study</b> to understand the Quran. We also believe, some verses are easier to interrupt and can be understood by people of nearly no knowledge. We feel to get an understanding of Quran we need a scholar who holds our finger and guides us to the right path.\nh3.b-left: It is a simple Book\np: Quran speaks volumes of only two things.\np: <span class=circle>1</span> Speak Truth even if you fear you will lose your life\np: <span class=circle>2</span> Believe you have a God around you.\np: And all other explanations are just secondary. There are verses, preaching us to distribute the wealth among poor, dividing the inheritance, maintaining relationships and fighting the disbelievers. But a higher view of <b class=brown>Quran only asks us to speak Truth</b>.\np: You must have heard people talk\nquote: Do not speak truth if it causes more harm than good.\np: This is a wrong interpretation of truth. It is called as <b>avoiding the truth</b>.\np: Inside our hearts we fear a little. We feel small, while we have most of our life right in front of our eyes, we do not want to lose a tiny part of it.\nh3.b-left: Walk Bold\np: You want to spread Islam, <b>the truth</b>. You want to give your fellows a public call like Prophet PBUH did standing on Mount Safa. Or you want to give a call to your fellows like Mosa (as) standing in front of Firown. That you want to stand at a round about, pin point all the wrongs and conclude your speech with “there is Allah and I request every one submit to Him”. A loud slogan. A loud call to Allah. So loud, people start labelling you Terrorist, Abnormal and Weird. Just like people did to Prophet Muhammad PBUH.\np: I say you are allowed. If you believe you do-not-fear losing the stability, you may consistently raise slogans of unity till you die. You may raise slogans of Allah / His Prophet (PBUH) sitting on youtube in spite of all boundaries / rules. You, my brother, should not wait, and start speaking the truth. Allah will protect you. It will not create divide. Neither havoc, nor violence. You will spread Islam like the way Prophets had spread it.\nh3.brown: 2. We are not there yet\nimg: destination.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Destination by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@bendavisual target=_blank>Benjamin Davies</a>\np: If you are unable to follow the footsteps of Prophets right now, you have no right to justify your cowardice with wrong interpretations of Islam. Accept the fear, cowardliness and weakness of Faith.\np: Just accepting the incompleteness, will make us better muslims. We will start working hard to achieve perfection. We will not act proud or cruel. We will not become a self-righteous devil. We will become humble. We will start respecting every call to Athan.\np: Start telling people, you are an in-complete muslim. You are not there yet. You have not yet achieved the point of Faith, where Prophets preached the message of Allah.\nh3.brown: Conclusion\np: Do not intervene. Do not create resistance. Do not hurt the feelings of spreader of righteous-ness. Just sit there, read the message, and smile. Because we Do not Know, who is closer to Allah. That prostitute, this Hindu, cruel Nazi or evil Firown. We are vulnerable beings, striving to pass the exam. And we will never know the message of Quran, until we “act” on it.\np.note.end: <br> Assalam o Alaikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuh (May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be with you). <br> This sinner has a poor command on English language and is not able to exactly express the thoughts.

        "body": "h1: The Limit\np.note: We need to define a limit to which we can bend. What exactly is the limit till which we are allowed to sacrifice our principles. Read lessons from Hudaybia and today’s conclusion.\nimg: desert1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Wadi Rum, Jordan by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@yuli_superson target=_blank>Yuliya Kosolapova</a>\np: An entire army of companions of Prophet (PBUH) begin their move to Mecca. White clothes, rubbed and dusted by the bushes and thrones. Wet with sweat. Faces glowing with hope. 1400 people marched from Madina to Mecca to finally perform the Hajj in year 6 AH. Muhammad (PBUH) leading the column from the front. Like a snake crawling in sand, the column advancing to the city of Muhammad (PBUH), believing “This is the Day we Conquer Mecca”. It was a tough ride on rocky mountains and scorching desert.\np: Soon, muslims reached the well of Hudaybia, where they faced the resistance and had come to an halt. Prophet (PBUH) along with his companions waited to reach a conclusion of settlement. Multiple suggestions rose up. Muslims were ready to fight another battle with Quraysh.\np: In the hustle, passion and hope; Muslims inside their hearts knew they will make it to Mecca this time. They will visit the Ibrahimic house victorious, because the Prophet, they blindly trusted had promised them a dream. It was never clearer, never right in front of Muslims. While so close, Prophet (PBUH) took one un-expected decision, against the desires of his companions.\nh3.b-left: The treaty of Hudaybia\np: Prophet (PBUH), the leader of the tribe, the person responsible for carrying out the move, the leader who had never told a lie, finally made an agreement with Quraysh. According to the agreement of Hudaybia;\np: <span class=circle>1</span> Muslims will be allowed to perform hajj after 1 year for only 3 x Days.\np: <span class=circle>2</span> A captive Muslim will not be returned to Muslims, however, a captive Meccan will be sent back to Mecca.\np: <span class=circle>3</span> Arab tribes are free to ally with any of the two groups; Muslims & Meccans.\np: <span class=circle>4</span> Treaty is valid for 10 years, during which no battle will take place between the two groups.\np: <span class=circle>5</span> Assets (trades) of Meccans are protected from any harm of Muslims.\np: <span class=circle>6</span> Muslims will be allowed to perform their rituals freely (even in Mecca).\nh3.b-left: The reaction\nimg: thorns.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Thorns by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@grin target=_blank>Andrey Grinkevich</a>\np: All the companions opposed the agreement. Rejected the message of Prophet (PBUH). Ali wrote down these points. He followed the instincts of Prophet while none in 1400 stood beside him. While the rejection and opposition was in the air, Prophet (PBUH) ordered the convoy to change their dress back from Ihram and prepare the rides to Madina.\np: This was it. No more suggestions, advises, opinions and speeches. Once the truth was opposed, Prophet (PBUH) gave one liner order and moved on with his personal preparations for Mecca.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Do not oppose the message of Islam. If you are opposing truth, there are no left and right arguments with it. It is black and white religion. It spreads unity. Protects poor. Builds economies. Creates welfare systems. Proves beneficial to every single entity of its states. If someone opposes the truth, it is a below the belt attack on Islam. There onwards, it is a one liner order. <b>This is the Limit</b>.\np.note.end: <br> Assalam o Alaikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuh (May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be with you). <br> This sinner has a poor command on English language and is not able to exactly express the thoughts.

How hard is balance?\nimg: scale1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Scale by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: My life is a roller coaster these days. Sitting at the front. One moment it is going up on its rails, slow, smooth and calm. Other moment, it is falling down, fast, harsh and rushed. Continuous attacks on my blogs and Meetup is being fortified and defended with true spirit and love. And to be honest, I can see love, Winning.\np: Today’s blog is broken down into two parts.\np.b-left: 1. What is Balance and how you can achieve it\np.b-left: 2. Why it is difficult even if you are going right\nh3: 1. What is balance and How you can achieve it\nimg: sunset.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sunset by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@alfaz7 target=_blank>Alfaz Sayed</a>\nh3.b-left: Definition\np: Balance is a smile on your face. In office, at home, on the jogging track and looking at your wife. While you can smile with an honest heart encountering all spheres of your life, you should tell yourself, you have achieved the perfect balance.\nh3.b-left: How you achieve it?\np: This is the toughest job in the world. To smile. To find the positives in a chaos. That your world seems falling apart, and you, sitting there on your couch, are eating pop corns. You are watching the world like it is a movie.\nh3.b-left: Define a purpose of your life.\np: Commit yourself to strive for that specific purpose. Make a drawing, hang it beside your bed, look at it every morning.\np: It will not take you apart from your responsibilities. It will not create an imbalance in your life. It will not impact your Job. It will not impact your health.\np: It will make you love your wife, profession, hobby and the morning walks. You will find it the source of your energy to push forward and succeed in all areas of your life.\nh3.b-left: No purpose ?\np: Without purpose, you are nothing but flesh and bones. You are moving in your life, heads down, eyes closed, brain shut. You do not walk with pride. You lack confidence. You fail in consistency and you fall more often.\np: Identify your purpose right now. Tomorrow you will see your life getting back on the track. Day after tomorrow your job will turn out to be your best source of income. Your friends will turn out the best source of inspirations. Your family will turn out the best source of love. Your life will become, Just Beautiful.\np: Purpose can not be, get a good rank, find a better home, buy the expensive car. It is not your goal. It is your blurred thoughts of wanting More. The purpose has to be linked with the good side of your heart. It has to reflect the Right of your life. It has to spread love, happiness, light and energy. You can build a school for poor, you can build an empire for broken, you can build a system for your next generations, you can defeat evil in all its might. You can take your purpose out of your Prophet’s life.\nh3.b-left: Lesson from life of Prophet (PBUH)\np: Prophet (PBUH) achieved the perfect balance. He was content, while he was being stoned at Taif. He was smiling, while he was migrating with Abu Bakr to Madina. He was sober, while he was leading 313 to Badr with 8 swords against 700 swords, 2 horses against 300 horses and 313 soldiers with broken sticks and beautiful hearts against 1000 Quraysh. He was happy when he sat with Khadija. He was calm when he visited Fatima. He had achieved the perfect balance.\np: His life was falling apart, for his enemies and closed ones, every minute of his life. No one had predicted a conquered Mecca in 21 years. No one had predicted a peaceful Madina in 13 years. No one had predicted he was going to win, while he lacked education.\np: The life of Prophet (PBUH) was purely on the right path. His friends were happy with him. He was giving due time to his responsibilities, state affairs, purpose and Quran. He was living a sober life.\nh3: 2. Why it is difficult even if you are going right?\nimg: walk1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Walk by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@ishassan target=_blank>Islam Hassan</a>\np: It is smile on your face, but inside it is battle. Admit it, the life of a successful person is not easily achieved. It wants hard ways on your curvy road to success. It is difficult.\np: It is not difficult, because you need to put in more amount of work. You compromise on few areas of your life. You lose at your responsibilities. It is difficult, because people put barriers in your path. You speak truth consistently for 2 days, your closed ones will start finding it irritated. You find a good hobby, people of no-hobby, will start labelling it abnormal, stupid and useless.\np: In the chaos, roads blocked, path to light barricaded, people throwing stones at you, you need to hold tight to your purpose. In the chaos, the only rope that will lead you out of the battle is the purpose. Make it amplified. Attractive. A beautiful picture of your dream.\np: Without the chaos, the barricades, the blocks, the fire on your way, you can not love the success. Allah wants you to taste the best fruits when you reach your destination. He wants you to love your stage, when you are standing in front of a crowd, walking like a leader, dancing the emotions and jumping the pride. When you are creating, designing and sketching the leaders of your own kind. That day, Allah wants you, you love your success. Today, Allah wants you to look at your purpose. Yesterday, He wanted you to “Define” your purpose.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: direction.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Direction by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@aronvisuals target=_blank>Aron Visuals</a>\np: I just want to assure my loved ones, friends, and readers, if you find my blogs abnormal, stupid, and weird. Speak it out. Tell me how much you hate them. Try to make me feel like a speck in the dirt. Drag me down. Make me realise I am a patient of mental health. Label me with the baddest words.\np: This will only tell me, “I am going in the right direction”. Because all good things come with fight, love and a calm heart. All good things come with a blind faith in Prophet’s Sunnah and Quran.\np.note.end: <br> Assalam o Alaikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuh (May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be with you). <br> This sinner has a poor command on English language and is not able to exactly express the thoughts.

But let’s foresee it.\nimg: jimcollins.jpg\np.text-center.caption: This blog is an explanation of a snippet from this book\np: We all are leaders. Somewhere in our life we are leading a tiny fraction of people. At times entire people, like subordinates. Most of the times a fraction of people, family and friends. We are leading emotions in our cross talks. Sometimes we are leading our own self out of bad decisions.\np: To lead, is an important trait of our life. We need to adapt it, to live a life of sobriety. Today’s topic is broken into following parts.\np.b-left: 1. Connecting Humility with Fearlessness\np.b-left: 2. The Fruit\nh3: 1. Connecting Humility with Fearlessness\nimg: abrahamlincoln.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Abraham Lincoln by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: I never found a word to describe the synonym of responsibility more easily. The work load, embracing the failures, accepting our own inefficiency makes us humble. Humble and Humility are equal words. Without accepting responsibility of the assigned responsibilities we can not reach the Humble part.\np: That said, it is important, we look our own self down. It is important we understand we are not fulfilling our responsibilities, as they are meant to be. It is important we count ourself a block in the  wall.\np: To become a great leader, you need to first “<b>stop taking credit</b>” of becoming the wheel that drives forward your company. Next stop thinking, you are “the secret ingredient”. And finally, embrace it, you are an incomplete human, filled with zillion flaws, not fulfilling your responsibilities and bow down your head for criticism.\np: Next comes connecting the Fearlessness with Humility.\np: To take the criticism, talk your failures loudly, open yourself up for judgment and walk naked (the Steve Jobs naked) is quite hard. It takes one solid spine to walk with your head high, while your life is all visible to the audience.\np: Here, an un-nerving belief in your failures, the purpose of these falls plays its role. The belief makes you fearless. You are able to bounce back the criticism effectively.\np: The initial bounces, thuds, falls and failures, finally take you over this line of continuous attacks of negativity. Conquering the attacks, finally makes you a fearless leader. Finally, you become a person that your family, friends and colleagues accepts in you. Finally, you embrace it, “You are incomplete”.\nh3: 2. The Fruit\nimg: dance.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Dance by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@yogendras31 target=_blank>Yogendra Singh</a>\np: The “struggle to becoming a leader” has fruits. It gives you freedom, no doubt. It gives your life a purpose, no doubt about that. It gives you a vision, a direction, a sword, a pen and some tools, no doubt. But the only fruit it gives you, is “<b>emotion</b>”.\np: You cry, your cry touches people’s heart. You laugh, it moves people. You talk, it resonates longer. You walk, it is looked at, copied and adopted. You rule, not people, not wealth, not a company, but emotions.\np: The emotions, connect you to your current life. You were still in-complete, half and impure. You still were not fulfilling your responsibilities. But it gives you a catalyst to heal the broken fabrics in your relations, friends and colleagues, faster. You simply become one abnormal speck in the dust, that has no self-respect, no self-esteem and no fear of losing. You just sit there. And the people around you, decorate you, embolden you, lift you up and save you from the kicks, splashes and rain. While you are a speck in a desert, the sand storms, floods and crowds, change their direction, <b>Only to protect you</b>.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: trumptower.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Trump tower by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@theshuttervision target=_blank>Jonathan Cooper</a>\np: Become a leader. The best. That smiles. Laughs. Runs. Eats. Takes pride in failures. Who is naked. One version of his personality. Some time attacked. Other times ruined. But standing firm. Not giving up on his Wife. Friends. Colleagues. Subordinates. That leader. Who is in-complete. That makes him Humble. That person. Who is flawed. That gives him Humility. One version. That makes you fearless. A glass. That rules the emotions.\np: Until then, keep running forward, pushing farther and hitting harder. Love your journey. Until then, walk with head held high. Chest wide. Like a symbol of Pride. Because, you might never reach there, the perfect company and a perfect leader, but you will surely reach where you will be ruling “emotions”. That your patchy sewed piece of cloth won’t harm you. That your shabby walk won’t lower you. That your broken voice won’t stop you. That you will walk like Muhammad, in the ruins, get the dirt like Abu Bakr, in the sandstorms, get the beating of Bilal, under the rock and rule the emotions like Hussain, at Karbala.\np: You, my brother, will love the journey. Just get Humble. Embrace Humility. Walk Fearless. And Become a Leader of your Clan.\np.note.end: <br> Assalam o Alaikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuh (May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be with you). <br> This sinner has a poor command on English language and is not able to exactly express the thoughts.

        "body": "h1: Functionality of “Now”\np.note: There is so much to do. Trello board. Checklists. Never reaching there, where we are over with our tasks. What is the solution. Let’s discuss time management.\nimg: clock1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Clock by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@insungyoon target=_blank>Insung Yoon</a>\np: Time is a fuzzy thing. It tells me it is in hurry. But when I look at it, it is paused, waiting for me to give it an order. “To just move”. I feel I am short of time. But when I try to think of finishing a task, it comes in an ample amount to let me finish all kinds of task.\np: Let us discuss, how we can kill our goals by making maximum use of the available time.\np.b-left: 1. Understanding “Now”\np.b-left: 2. Iterate “Quicker”\nh3: Understanding “Now”\nimg: hit.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Hit by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@chris_chow target=_blank>Chris Chow</a>\np: Do not burden your life with extra todos. Lengthy tasks. Un-necessary cluttered checklists. Keep tasks minimal. Short with achievable parts. That if you move a little, you are able to kill it a little on your checklist. Keep it simple.\np: Do not plan much. Think alot. Force yourself further. Stop at planning. Planning and actions are meant to be weighed together. If in any case, your  time spent on “planning” surpasses your time spent on “actions”, you are compromising on quality of your content. Great content comes after “actions”. Lengthy planning and weaker action dulls down your final product.\np: You can make maximum use of the available time by not writing another checklist. But by picking up the most difficult task in your life, that is halting you right “Now”. And get on with its finishing. Finish it quicker. Move to the next most difficult task, finish that quicker. And move, hit, fail, move, hit, fail. Keep the cycle of iterations running.\np: By the time few hours of this halted time have passed you by, you would have reached closer to your envisioned line of success. You would have done things that really turn your life around. You would have taken few bold, brave steps towards finishing the hards in your life. As these harder tasks are done, you will feel victorious, confident and brave. And consistently hitting your harder goals, down this road, will make you an inspiration for your community..\nquote: The highest human act is to inspire. <br> <a href= https://twitter.com/NipseyHussle target=_blank>Nipsey Hussle</a>\np: That is why, <b>Do not wait for the next day</b>, to start your much awaited task. <b class=brown>Start it “Now”</b>.\nh3: Iterate “Quicker”\nimg: published.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Published by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@webaroo target=_blank>Webaroo</a>\np: Well, if you make use of “Now” every other day, it is definitely going to get boring. You will lose track of its hidden strength. You will find it not-so-productive. And you may give up on your  agenda.\np: In order to make sure all tasks of your life, reach their good final. You are required to create smaller chunks of your product, that are useable, validate-able and shareable, more often.\np: The start of your task, should reach an ending, that is presentable. It can be a little shabby, broken and ugly. But it needs to fulfil a certain functionality that is feedback-able. The presented product, has to be “useable” in some fashion.\np: Once you are able to make smaller chunks frequently, like the series of these blogs every day, your quality of product will start improving. Ultimately, your smaller chunks will turn into bigger chunks that will have a better design, functionality and utility.\np: I suggest, you iterate your creations, everyday. Everyday, make 1 thing, that is complete in itself. That is shareable with your friends / family / boss. That brings you to accountability of your ‘days’ efforts. That tells you, how you need to bulge on your next time of availing the ‘Now’ of your day.\np: It will lead you to finally reaching your goal everyday of your life. And the goals that are iterate-able, that can be met everyday, are your real goals. Such reachable goals lift the quality of your life.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: quitejob.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Quite by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@andrewtneel target=_blank>Andrew Neel</a>\np: Time management is an art. It is quite a job. The mastery of it, takes some toll. It wants your attention, dedication, discipline and hard work. The time, bears fruits, brings colours, changes the flow of your days and makes the dull days turn into productive days. Time alone, is the master of all mantras.\np: If you have not yet decided to move, I say, <b>Now</b> is the perfect time to move towards your goals. Now, get into action. Not sleep. Not wait. Not tomorrow. Now, make your life take the final turn, that takes you to your dreams.\np.note.end: <br> Assalam o Alaikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuh (May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be with you). <br> This sinner has a poor command on English language and is not able to exactly express the thoughts.

Truth is beautiful, a sorry doesn’t hurt it.\niframe.w-75.d-block: https://www.youtube.com/embed/IE6KhNlpK7A\np.text-center.caption: Molana Tariq Jameel apologises\np: Truth, is one beautiful product. It does not take a day’s effort of hard work. It does not require thorough planning. It does not demand any of our precious time. It just happens; plain, old, simple, straight and fearless.\np: Yet we are afraid of speaking truth. It is not found more often today, when it is needed the most. We do not speak truth. We do not take the leap of Faith. We do not recall we are Muslim. We do not remind ourselves, this is it, the world, is just a bubble; about to explode.\np: Let us help us push ourselves to fixing our today, right now, by realising following things.\np.b-left: 1. Truth is not much Loud\np.b-left: 2. Stop banking on people\nh3: Truth is not much Loud\nimg: loud.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Loud by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: Some congregational prayers, some Quran recitations and some honest talk gatherings. Some kids graduating from pure Islamic Madrassahs. Some Hufaaz reciting Quran ahead in Ramadan nights. These are not loud activities. These activities are there, considered just that, an activity; attended and forgotten.\np: We are not speaking truth louder. We are not propagating the message of Quran loud enough. We are not louder than fake lies, Netflix channels and music filled mobile phones. Accept it, we are not making the tone of our actions, loud enough, that would suppress the beatings of poor at the hand of the riches.\np: Just like Molana Tariq Jameel, make the tone of truth loud enough that dugs deep into the roots of false hood. That even after you ask for forgiveness, you be “sorry”, you still win the hearts, motions and news. You still stand victorious.\np: Believe it, the truth, itself is hard, easiest thing to do, and the shortest route to success. Without truth, without it being louder and without it being resonating in the ears of falsehood, you might never reach the podium of success. Without a mega phone, a loud call, you might never break the shackles of slavery, narrow-ness and dullness.\nh3: Stop banking on People\nimg: directed.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Directed walk by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@devjustesen target=_blank>Devin Justesen</a>\np: The siblings, parents, friends and colleagues, are just people. You do not bank on them. Do not ask them for favours. Do not reach out to them for help. You stop banking on people. You need to stop thinking, they can help you.\np: Like Muhammad (PBUH), hold tight to the rope of truth. Quran. Light. Allah. Wisdom. A smile. Hold tight to the Life inside your own self. Hold tight to the oozing energy of your own. Hold on to the bravery. Willingness to die for your purpose. Hold on. To Allah.\np: One person can not change your life. A 100 people can not bring you success. Thousands can not hear your voice. Millions can not prove beneficial. One heart, that connects to Allah, is more worthy than a zillion hearts, not close to Allah. One heart, one truth and one humility of Prophet (PBUH) made Allah appoint him the Last of all His messengers. <b>The best student in humans, made the Creator, create a universe</b>.\np: Allah does not want 100 people following His path. He simply does not want us to work for Him. He is not bothered how much you look, feel and walk on His path. He has abundance of creations prostrating to Him, every second. He does not want our Ibadahs, sincerity and rituals. He wants our Love. The extent to which we are willing to fight for His message. Just that, what we are willing to lose in His path.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: good.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sky by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@wistomsin target=_blank>Tom Barrett</a>\np: We are not good muslims. We are incomplete. Patchy. Broken. Useless. We know we are not fully ready for death.\np: The problem arises, when we take pride in our compared-to-nothing achievements. When we label ourselves hard-worker, good, perfect and complete.\np: We need to tell ourselves, people around us, far friends, “we are incomplete”. We need to be humble. Down. Near the earth. We need to stop taking credit. We need to stop bragging. We need to stop labelling others. We need to just accept, we are in-complete. Not ready. Not willing. Not friend of Prophet (PBUH). We are not there, Not yet.\np.note.end: <br> Assalam o Alaikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuh (May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be with you). <br> This sinner has a poor command on English language and is not able to exactly express the thoughts.

I believe if an organisation as big as universe, changes into Madina, it will have an impact.\np: Now act like the state of Madina.\np.b-left: 1. Do not point fingers at Meccans. Utilise this time to prepare yourself for Badr, Uhud, Khandaq.\np.b-left: 2. Keep the streets, roads, houses and mosques clean. Inside this circle, pure.\np.b-left: 3. Inspire the tribes in your neighbourhood to join you in your fight against Meccans. Do not fight them, but inspire them.\np.b-left: 4. Be professional. That you fulfil your promises, speak honest and become a true reflection of Muhammad PBUH.\np: I know it is difficult. To change that your state becomes Madina, today. Therefore, you do not deserve a Madina yet. You won’t get it. Your cries, whimpers and opinions won’t give you much. Your Prime Minister won’t make your state flourishing like the state of Madina, you dream.\np: If you change right now, tomorrow you will find the abundance, love, wealth, happiness and relations, as good as the state of Madina. Allah swt will give you a pen, a sword, a ride that you will run towards Mecca. You won’t swing your sword. And Allah will give you a Mecca, a Taif, a Syria, a Jerusalem. You won’t have to declare war, or raise a slogan, or act louder. You will win, tomorrow, only after you make your circle, the state of Madina.\nh3: Let Allah guide you\nimg: sharjah.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sharjah Mosque by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@asifgraphy target=_blank>Asif Ali Yousafzai</a>\nquote: O you who believe! Seek help through patience and the prayer. Indeed, Allah (is) with the patient ones. <br> Surah Baqarah verse 157\np: As the circle, the state of Madina, resides inside you. You will find the opportunities presenting itself to you. Wealth flowing in. Relatives calling you. Brothers and sisters reaching out to you. You will see your life change already. It will become one ride filled with joy, love and adventure. You will have your adrenaline pumping, most part of your days. Each moment, it will be a game, your small talks and lengthier actions will start bearing fruits.\np: In these downs, ups, falls and thuds, you will feel confused. At times, you will see the victory standing at your gate, you open it and it is all blank. At times nothing is visible and all of a sudden you find the highly awaited news. In such hard times, let Allah take control of your ride. You bend down your head, walk with humility, embrace critiques, love enemies, hug humiliators and ask Allah for help. Let Allah, plan your next minute, hour, day, life. Let Him, lead your way.\np: Soon, you will find, the present moments are the most blessed. The small bird chirps will start cheering you. The tv remote and desi dramas will relax you. The wife will comfort you. The fan, the flow of air, the fall on your feet, the gravity, the nature will put you in awe. You won’t be able to get away from counting blessings. When you will be riding your horse, running with sword, and conquering the world inside your circle, your falls will only cheer you.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: self1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Self by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@randvmb target=_blank>Randy Jacob</a>\np: No Qadiyani is not kaafir. Hindu is not kaafir. Jew is not kaafir. The murderer is not kaafir. No, not yet. There is no Madina inside you, yet. You do not inspire people. You do not act Muhammad. You do not make your Allah proud of you yet. You, until do not create a Madina inside you, have no authority, spine and right to label anybody a kaafir.\np: Become a Madina first. Someone, who creates art. Promotes science. Makes libraries. Teaches Google, Microsoft and Apple. Become a brand first. Become someone who is respected first. Become a Saadiq and al-Amin first. Until you do not become one, you have No wisdom / understanding / knowledge / certificate to label a Hindu, a Jew, a Qadyani, a Christian a kaafir. Because, you are not there yet, you have no right to attack the states outside your circle of Madina, yet.\np.note.end: <br> Assalam o Alaikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuh (May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be with you). <br> This sinner has a poor command on English language and is not able to exactly express the thoughts.

It was sheer distress, extreme heat and a huge test to separate the true slaves of Allah from disbelievers.\np: The verse tells the believers rejoice, every verse of Quran. When they hear Quran, they lower their head in prostration and ask for forgiveness. When they hear the verses of Allah, they tremble, shake and cry. To tell honest, I don’t tremble yet, shake or cry yet.\np: We are nothing, but slaves of Allah. Our life times of prayers, efforts and sadaqats won’t help us. The slight impurity, pride or hypocrisy inside our hearts renders us in-eligible to Allah’s mercy.\np: The thought of incompleteness has so overwhelmingly taken over me, I feel I might never make it. Some tell me, it is disappointing and some say it is negativity. But it is a war, a continuous run, a sequel of falls that is needed out of me. I am not worried, right now. I am not running fast enough. I am not hitting the limits frequent enough. I am not crying. The verse above is neither proving rejoice-full for me, nor motivational. If I look back, at the run so far, I have not moved yet. I am standing still, thinking, I am not ready yet.\np: A state where I do not see a beggar roaming the streets. None needs zakat. None feels unjust. None is harmed. No cast. No rich. No poor. A state, where everyone is equal, honest and loving. Somewhere, where we feel we are closer to Allah. A place where we see ourselves as His messengers. That we make Him proud of us.\np: I have not packed my bags yet. I have not yet gathered the courage to move towards the solution. I lack the strength, meat and zeal to take the step and change it all.\nh3: 2.

At no point, I stop at moving. At no point, I not tell people there is Allah, we are going to meet. Never, I halt, look back and tell myself, I  travelled much enough.\np: Some day, the world might understand, the rich might get a hint, the luxurious might find, the wealth, the richness and the beauty lies in simplicity. It lies in helping poor. It lies in sharing, caring and spreading light. It lies in building schools, raising slaves and embracing failures. Some day, the people, might find, it is all inside Quran.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: sea.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Molokini Crater, Maui, United States by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@whereisfarid target=_blank>Farid Askerov</a>\np: Consider it a sea, the fishes and the water.

The book creating slaves.\np: I am a slave of Allah. I am His, creation. My hours, minutes and seconds are only His. I, the soul inside, to the flesh outside, is His to control. I am nothing but a speck in the desert. I am a sinner. I am not the way He wanted me to be. I am not making Him proud of me. I am not there yet. I am not, the true believer yet. I am incomplete, as incomplete as a Hindu, a Christian, a Jew or a Blaspheme.

Turkish scientists, doctors and athletes, who due to lack of opportunities had left their home towns, saw an opportunity back in their homes and relocated back.\np: Yesterday, our Prime Minister made an amazing remark on our foreign nationals. “They did not have enough opportunities in Pakistan, due to corruption and mafia-ism, and had the only option left but to move out of Pakistan. They are our best assets, for being great scientists, engineers and doctors.”\np: Imagine, these people returning to Pakistan, like Tania Andrus ex Google Employee who has drastically impacted the tech familiarity, will create a new world inside Pakistan.\np: Ok, these are predicted good things. But we will not predict good things today. We will talk only past 2 years.\np.b-left: 1. Freedom of Poor\np.b-left: 2. Development of Trust\nh3: 1. Freedom of Poor\nimg: lahore.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Lahore by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@gr8muzamil target=_blank>Muhammad Muzamil</a>\np: No 1 thing, I am most excited about, is our Mosques are open. The only country in the world, where Mosques are open. I feel free when I practice my religion, talk to my community, read Quran a loud and attend Friday Congregational prayers. The opening of Mosques has significantly controlled spread of Corona. It has given a sense of responsibility, discipline and harmony to its regular attendees.\np: No 2 thing, poor were affected back in 2017. People, near and below poverty line, were suffering with Hepatitis, Malayria and Dengue but no one was bothered about them. Our government hospitals were in quite worst conditions. They were being used only for treatment of people who couldn’t afford private hospitals. Private hospitals are used in this country for treatment of middle class. And Dubai hospitals are for upper class. None in the country; the media, the news outlets, the schools, the parliament ever talked about sufferings of poor. They died in huge numbers and further went into chaos. But up there in the Parliament, the people in good cars and grandeur homes in Islamabad, never really knew. <b>Today, the poor are given Rs 12,000 per family by the upper most class</b>. Finally someone from the upper class has penetrated through thick cloud of pride, injustice and lawlessness to reach out to poor and help them.\np: Number 3 thing, I travelled from Punjab to Northern Pakistan up till Khunjarab, last year. I saw people of KPK and GB lit bright with beautiful opportunities. More foreign travellers, bikers and climbers are entering their regions. More snow resorts are being built. The roads and cafes are being constructed. Cafe Sweet Tooth at Attabad lake is charging visitors in USD.\np: Poor are free. Do not underestimate this new Pakistan. They are more in number than few rich elites. They are happy with the Prime Minister. They will go out of their way to get him re-elected. The hard talks, the judgements and numerous lies, won’t impact the hard earned freedom of poor. We the middle class, they the upper class, might find it harsh and blunt but; we are being stripped apart of our Freedom.\nh3: 2. Development of Trust\nimg: pakistan1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Pakistani flag by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@sameer_akhtari target=_blank>Sameer Akhtari</a>\np: Famous anchors, popular Military, previous rulers and the disciplined literate, might still reject the new Coin. But, the world outside Pakistan and the humble inside Pakistan are accepting this new Coin whole heartedly.\np.b-left: USA, Mike Pompeo, credited Pakistan for being on the same lines of preventing Corona as themselves.\np.b-left: MIF, heard the call of Government to give debt relief to all developing countries.\np.b-left: Yesterday, PM of Iran showed intent to resume trade with Pakistan.\np.b-left: Molana Tariq Jameel is meeting frequently with the Prime Minister. He is frequently, honoring his honesty. He is frequently destroying the closed-box mentality.\np.b-left: People of Bangladesh, Muslims of India, Malaysia, Turkey are finding hope in our Prime Minister. We the people who were harmed, hurt and destroyed in our past, are finding him honest. He is quoting Iqbal in his sermons, mentioning books like “lost history of Islam” and reminding dates from Badr, Yarmouk and Al Qudssiyah.\np: Clearly, Pakistan is succeeding in every battle against failures. It is moving exactly on the lines that made Pakistan a great new world in South Asia back in 1970s. The people, I specially, are finding inspiration in Imran Khan’s everyday addresses to move forward with more zeal, passion and love.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: change.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Change by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@jasonhk1920 target=_blank>Jason Wong</a>\np: If you do not find Pakistan on the path to success. You will be left out of the great wealths, successes and skills as it hits the podium of success. It is not the time to waste another minute sitting inside our enclosed boxes. It is not the time to not take a mega action to get on-board the train of New Pakistan. It is not the time to argue. It is not the time to think for another moment. It is the time to change.

Like your family asks you, “What is wrong with you?” And you tell them “I do not have my dream house up in Ireland yet. I can’t walk straight unless I have it.” There! Shed some tears.

It is a day, up in heavens.\np: Relatives showing you their farms on a video call, you planning at the back of the mind a movie in Cinema, thinking of sitting at a good cafe and having a romantic dinner with your wife. It is an afternoon up in heaven.\np: You ride your bike to the central park. Jog a little. Sweat. Pumped. Feeling brave. You take shower. You go to bed. Think of a sky filled with sprinkling stars. You have it all. It is an evening up in heaven.\np: Did you miss your flight? Break your favourite dining set? Failed in exam? Hit your toe? Got infected with Corona? Lost someone? Did hell break loose on you?\np: Don’t worry. It is temporary. Once you reach your destination, you will find these losses worth it. You will wish more losses your way. More misery your way. More pain your way. That day, once you will be weighed against the “difficult life scale”, you will be wanting more difficulties your way, today.\np: This world, the death, the grave and the day in front of your Allah.

Reward gives you happiness. Happiness gives you abundance. Abundance gives you contentment. Contentment gives you patience. Patience gives you your destination.\np: Iterate this cycle in your life more often. Start with the acting, then embrace the pain. Find a fight. Hit it. Bend. Lose an arm. Win the battle. Become happy. Abundant. Patient. Your arm will grow back. Your losses will heal back. Your misery will avert. Get back into pain. Fight again. Hit again. Lose your life again. Now get happier.

It looks ugly and distorted. More I search about him on google, more we have blurred his message. Labelled him super natural, out of this world, majestic and un-reachable. This is not how Prophet PBUH wanted himself in 2020.\np: He wanted libraries, co-working spaces, laboratories, research centres inside the mosques. He did not want his name would be decorated with glittering letters and hanged on signboards.\nquote: Umar ibn al-Khattab reported:- I entered the room of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was lying on his side over a mat. I sat down as he drew up his lower garment and he was not wearing anything else. The mat had left marks on his side. I looked at the Prophet’s cupboard and I saw a handful of barely in a small amount, the same of mimosa leaves in the corner, and a leather bag hanging to the side. My eyes started to tear up, and the Prophet said, “<b class=brown>What makes you weep, son of Khattab?</b>” I said, “O Prophet of Allah, why should I not cry that this mat has left marks on your side and I see little in this cupboard? Caesar and Khosrau live among fruits and springs, while you are the Messenger of Allah and His chosen, yet this is your cupboard.” The Prophet said, “<b class=brown>O son of Khattab, are you not pleased that they are for us in the Hereafter and for them in the world?</b>” I said, “Of course.” <br> - Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 1479\np: Look at yourself. You carry yourself in a car, sit in an office, eat from the restaurants and go on walks at night. Thinking, Islam allows luxury, freedom and a rich lifestyle.\np: You value yourself more than the speck on the floor. You are not humble. Not worthy of the luxury. Not the way, your Prophet PBUH would have been proud of you.\nh3: A Complicated Creature\nimg.width-m-half: infinite.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Infinite by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@cfitz target=_blank>Cody Fitzgerald</a>\np: It is not measurable, the evaluation of a human being.

One day, it all will be in its reach. The human will conquer it all.\nh3: Conclusion\np: If you think, you are a valuable machine. You will be carried away with the notion, the pride and selfishness. If you think you are small, you will become humble, low and lifeless.\np: The answer lies in the book of Quran. You do not measure yourself. You do not give yourself credit. You do not tell the world it is ‘you’ the solution. You do not say ‘no’ to a problem. You just exist. There. Out in the open. All vulnerable and deadly. All small yet lively. All sanity yet crazy. All wisdom yet childly. You just exist there. Not asking, why, how and when.

        "body": "h1: Corona’s blazing fast spread in the West\np.note: It is luxury, strong linkage with comfort, extra cautiousness and lower immunity towards harsh life. May be the rich life style gives us a weaker mindset.\nimg: covid19.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Covid19 by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: You wake up in a cosy bed, central cooling system keeping the temperature live-able, voice enabled electric system, a good configured house, outside a metalled road, insured car in the garage and a sober income. These are ingredients of a rich life. These are not found much often in Pakistan. And I am quite sure, most of these facilities are available to common people in the West.\np: I am not anti-luxury, poverty-hooked and a self-righteous person. I surely love a country having a good economy, lesser poverty and luxury at the door of every house. In fact, I want this is how Pakistan becomes some day sooner. But with luxury comes the cost, let’s discuss its impact on immunity from viruses.\np.b-left: 1. The Problem\np.b-left: 2. The Solution\nh3: 1. The Problem\nimg: bmw.jpg\np.text-center.caption: BMW by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: The biggest impact of luxury is on mental health. It dulls down the senses to feel grateful. Common problems like, a broken car, a damaged TV and lack of enough money, starts looking bigger. Continuously living a life of richness decreases the overall satisfaction of people.\np: West was not like this some days back, after the World War and Cold War. While the Churchill was sending boats to Dunkirk, it was in a state of War. The channels were ruthlessly defended. People were willing to die more often. Death had become a pride. Sometimes USA was moving at a lightening speed to conquer Japan and other times it was one good landing at Normandy. Once the fight was on, the west was finding comfort in lower instances of achievements. A son returning home meant a huge victory back in 40s, today a son returning home from the Job is not at all a victory.\np: Corona, is different from Malaria, Hepatitis and Dengue. It does not affect people who live a life below the line of poverty. It affects every one. The rich, the clean and the protected. It is carried with the air. Invisible yet lethal. Small yet deadly. It is quite a virus.\np: Today, the west has become numb. The excess of wealth has pored into houses. The people are living much better life than people of Pakistan. More food on table, better houses, roads dividing villages, earth dug transport systems, good passports, better sense of freedom and lack of fulfilment curbed at the wineries and playgrounds. More noise and smaller hearts. People are losing the real charisma and are badly dependant on artificial luxuries.\np: If you ask me, the lack of nature has impacted the overall quality of life. The farther the West went from the morning chirps, cows in green fields, the evening horse rides, huts and the life of countryside, the farther they went from a healthier life. They became weaker. Every problem that knocked at their door, is now entertained, embraced and accepted.\np: Corona is just that, a problem, knocking at everybody’s door. West embraced it quickly. And in East, people are still not opening their doors.\nh3: 2. The Solution\nimg: flowers.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Flowers by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: Social distancing, more ventilators, stricter lockdown, wearing mask, less gatherings in houses, at shops, on streets and quality apps to enforce the control of the writ of WHO / medical institutes. Well, it is all honestly, nothing but a wasted pile of junk. The world has failed at controlling the writ. Humans are social animals, the more you try to lock them down, the more they stand on streets outside marts with their trolleys waiting for their turn to collect the food. It is not possible. It is not the solution. It has not worked in China, Japan and USA. It can not work.\np: The solution is “Tiger Force”. A force, that gets out of houses, picks up ration bags, creates a new cloud of welfare system, runs home to home and delivers ration. A force, that knocks at our door and gives a glad tiding. Some deliver a handsome of donation and some deliver a pizza. The people running at a lightning speed in Wuhan on their bikes, delivering the medics, constructing the hospitals and uniting like a rock, built a nation. And a nation, managed to win the war.\np: Pakistan, has literally established a force, named as “Tiger Force”. Its motto is solely to replicate the formula of Wuhan in Pakistan. It has managed to highlight numerous houses that are in trouble. It has gathered in thousands. One Government mobile app named as “The Citizen Portal” is being used to register these young people, who are willing to stand in fire, for their country.\np: A nation won’t rise, without people. A nation can’t die, for its people. A nation does not exist without the people, who lit bright, spread light and fight fearless.\np: Today, if you want to win the battle against Corona, try getting out of your houses. Try fighting. Try dying for your brothers and sisters. You will find you might never get the hit. You might never bog down. You might never get ill. You, the West, will get out of Corona. You need to revive yourself, once again, to stand victorious, in this battle against Corona.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg.width-m-half: happyface.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Happiness by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: Do not act panic. Do not snatch somebody’s ration. Do not act animal. Do not shut down your neighbour, your father or your mother. Do not think it will not hit you. Do not!\np: Embrace it as such. It is a calamity. It will maximum, kill you. You will die. With your death this way, you will have saved the entire Europe and the entire World.\np.note.end: <br> Assalam o Alaikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuh (May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be with you). <br> This sinner has a poor command on English language and is not able to exactly express the thoughts.

We all will be judged against our actions.\nimg: nuhark.jpg\np.text-center.caption: The structure claimed to be the Nuh’s Ark near the Mount Arat in Turkey\nquote: And recite to them the news of Nuh, when he said to his people, “O my people, if my residence and my reminding of the signs of Allah has become burdensome upon you - then <b class=brown>I have relied upon Allah</b>. So <b class=brown>resolve upon your plan and [call upon] your associates</b>. Then let <b class=brown>not your plan be uncertain</b> to you. Then <b class=brown>carry it out upon me and do not give me any respite</b>. <br> - Surah Younis verse 71\np: I read the above verse of Quran. Until today, I thought to myself the efforts of Nuh (as) were in vain mostly, because of his failure in convincing masses towards Allah. But more I read about him, more I find myself incorrect.\np: The lessons from the above verse are;\np.b-left: 1. Do not Count Heads\np.b-left: 2. Allah (swt) values the struggle\nh3: 1. Do not Count Heads\nimg: people1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: People by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@ryoji__iwata target=_blank>Ryoji Iwata</a>\np: More followers on twitter, more people on wedding, more people in our audience, more heads visiting our websites and more fans listening to us. We are striving to get more people to listen to us. We want fame, loud applauses and meaning-less encouragements. We only count heads.\np: The struggle of Nuh (as) had been a 850 years long journey. In 850 years he managed to find nearly 80 people around him, who understood his message and converted to Islam. After continues negation, he was asked to build an ark that will save him and his people of Allah’s punishment.\np: Nuh (as) is considered the “second Adam”, for the entire world’s population met its end. The pairs of plants to insects to animals were put in his ark and protected from the flood. His son was among those people who drowned and rejected his message.\np: Prophet Nuh (as) did not give up on building a boat, on sugar coating the message of Allah and on choosing the easier path to hit people’s heart. He was content with 80 followers. He did not count heads. He converted the 80, the best 80 of his time. He motivated them, inspired them and brought them to pinnacle of leadership. He gave them his own place. And these 80 later carried forward his legacy.\np: I have not yet reached at convincing 1 person to find Quran as amazing as it used to amaze the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his companions. I have not yet reached at raising 1 person who can stand like Nuh (as) or Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). I have not yet succeeded in convincing 1 person; there is Allah who is all around us, who is worth our wealth, attention and sacrifice.\np: Prophet Nuh (as) is quoted as one of the greatest leader in the history. He valued each person who stood beside him. He raised leaders. Built empires. Rejected masses. Relied blind. Called a loud. Challenged blunt. Fought brave. Prophet Nuh (as) acted a wall against falsehood.\nh3: 2. Allah (swt) values the struggle\nimg.width-m-half: struggle1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Strength by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@ianchen0 target=_blank>Ian Chen</a>\np: The struggle, the journey, the run and the sweat. Allah (swt) values the craving, the craziness and the will. He doesn’t look at the results. He doesn’t want more people follow our call. He just wants us to raise the call. He doesn’t want people listening through us, He only values our intent.\np: The humans are built on the sunnah’s of Allah (swt). He wants us to act like Him; pure, honest and loving. He wants we do not look towards the results, he wants we look at the run towards the results. He does not want us winning every battle, he wants us to show up in battle. He doesn’t need more people in Paradise, he wants few who deserve the paradise. He just wants to segregate the ones who stand for Him, from the ones who stand against Him.\np: Muhammad (PBUH)’s 1.8 Billion people in Ummah, might never make it up to the 80 muslims from the Nuh (as). Musa (as)’s millions might never prove their worth as of Nuh’s people. The Yousaf, Yaqub, Ismail, Daud and all the prophet’s combined, might never make it upto the Nuh’s follower-ship. The number, the heads, the total quantity is of bleak value for Allah. He only values quality.\np: If we look at it, the quality way, we will get one much awaited answer to the question; “Will we succeed on the day of Judgement?”\np: We do not know. We are not a quality product yet. Our quantity does not carry the meaning. Each one of us, has a meaning. If we start becoming a quality product today, we might not find good 80 people who listens to our call towards Allah. But we might find a place for Allah’s mercy in the life hereafter. We might rise with Nuh (as) and we might make Allah proud of us.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: inside.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Inside by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@vkings target=_blank>Vitor Pádua</a>\np: You are a good person. You have few negatives, few positives. You have been criticised in the past. You have been told you are not good enough. But believe me, you are a wonderful human being inside. You were always right in your life. You only missed few opportunities. You only walked slower. You only thought yourself down. Have the confidence, the freedom and the thinkings of Nuh (as) and Muhammad (saw). You can become just like them overnight. You can walk just like them. You can win people’s heart just like them. You can live a life of freedom just like them. You will be saved with another Ark. Or you will be blessed with angels to fight for you. You will start winning your battles starting today. The only need, the only desire, the only compulsion that awaits you, is Change. Today, change. Tomorrow, fail. Day after tomorrow, conquer. Normalcy no more. Laziness no more. Sleeping wasted no more. Just become the person, that you inside yourself believe in, today. Not the person, somebody else wants out of you. Just you, the way you want to see you, at your destination One Day.\np.note.end: <br> Assalam o Alaikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuh (May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be with you). <br> This sinner has a poor command on English language and is not able to exactly express the thoughts.

        "body": "h1: Creating a great product\np.note: It is not the product that stands out. Neither the effort. It is only a purpose that gives meaning to our products. A story, that transforms simple products into great products.\nimg: story.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Story by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@tobiastu target=_blank>Tobias Tullius</a>\np: Purpose gives you fire. Fire creates stories. Stories put meaning into products. Your product connected with a story stands out. Similar products lacking transparency, agenda, purpose and a story do not win trust. They do not rise. They do not become Great. They stay there, in the corner of ‘good’ products and one day fade out.\np: Let’s dive into steps involved in creating a great product.\np.b-left: 1. Find a purpose\np.b-left: 2. Hit it\np.b-left: 3. Be available\np.b-left: 4. Get a burning Fire\nh3: 1. Find a purpose\nimg: search.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Search by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@lazycreekimages target=_blank>Michael Dziedzic</a>\np: Something that stands out. A school, a rule, a narrative, a thought or a vision. Purpose is not a product. It is neither selfish nor self-centric. It changes something wrong around you. It seems impossible to achieve yet achieve-able. Difficult yet simple. Mad yet sober. It is something that breaks your barriers, gives you faith and guides you to take crazy steps.\nh3: 2. Hit it\nimg: boxer.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Boxer by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@nathzg target=_blank>Nathz Guardia</a>\np: Run towards your purpose like your life depends upon it. That once you hit it, it breaks something. Creates a new life. Is quoted in a history book. Inspires your next generation.\np: It seems doubtful and un-natural. But this is how it is; retarded, clumsy, shady and Great. Your final product, has no imperfection inside it. It is not critique-able, challenge-able or beat-able.\nh3: 3. Be available\nimg: humble.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Humble by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@abdghat target=_blank>Abdullah Ghatasheh</a>\np: One important purpose doesn’t give you the freedom to compromise on your responsibilities. It doesn’t let you walk on your self construed path. It doesn’t give you the pride. It simply doesn’t elevate you in your people.\np: You act tiny. While you are rushing towards your purpose, you need to act humble. You need to be available for help. You need to pull others, hold them tighter that you bring them along. The people around you, are your momentum.\nh3: 4. Burning Fire\nimg: fire1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Fire by <a href=https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay target=_blank>Pixabay</a>\np: The most important step in making a great product, is to lit a volcanic fire inside you. It oozes out of your eyes, tongue, work and sentences. At times this fire hurts people. Most times it connects people. And always it creates a Great product.\np: If you do not have the fire yet, try to “Act” like you have one inside you. To be honest, I don’t have it yet. But I act like it is oozing out of my body. When I act louder, blunt and ruthless, it changes the meaning of the talk. Emotions come running into our gatherings. Some make faces and some find it harsh. But the artificial fire, creates a momentum. A momentum that fights for you, beside you and pushes you.\np: The fire is linked with the purpose. The purpose is linked with the truth. The truth is linked with Quran. And Quran is linked with Allah. That said, fire 🔥 comes, when you start including Allah in your equations.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: ticking.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Ticking by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@ariel_pilotto target=_blank>Ariel Pilotto</a>\np: If you do not want to create a product yet, I say, you are getting late. Start with the wanting, already. You do not have another day to waste. Tomorrow it will be 24 x 60 x 60 x 1000 = 86,400,000 milliseconds wasted. Each milli, is a million sparks inside your body. Each spark is a particle of the fire you are looking for. If these sparks are not lit today, encompassed inside a purpose and put to work that takes to your dream, you will have wasted a life time of sparks till tomorrow. You will lag behind. You will lose more than you know. And you will fail tomorrow.\np: Take one small action today. Make an announcement and jump into fire. You will either lose, fail or fall. But you will have learnt one thing. Tomorrow the one thing will make you more educated, better learned and something beautiful than you are today. Tomorrow, you will be 1 step closer to creating the Great Product. ",

The people living in big houses, treating servants in-humane and those do not having the pain for poor are our enemies.\nimg: palace.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Palace by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@dialex target=_blank>Diogo Nunes</a>\np: I was having a walk with my neighbour, Hamid, today in the morning. It was a good walk, a lively discussion. We saw bigger houses, modern sport facilities and dedicatedly built dining places. We also saw few smaller houses built for servants. Passed a grave yard and reminded ourselves, it is temporary, life is going to end soon, we all will disappear. Told each other, we will travel North, cook BBQ, some dives, rafting, climbing, will make videos and build a dedicated brand “the Tourist”. We will take people along and show them the unwavering beauty of Northern Pakistan.\np: It is not easy to celebrate our life the way we want to celebrate it. As soon as we share our beautifully built dreams, people ruin them. They put in suggestions, advises, safer ways and fears to let us know, our dreams are not good enough. Well, I know now, my dream and my brother’s Hamid dream, is good enough. It can not get better, impure or distorted with few suggestions. We therefore reached at a point, <b>we need to identify our enemies</b>.\nh3: Let’s start!\nimg: peace1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Peace by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@breakfast_on_jupiter target=_blank>Aleksandr Ledogorov</a>\np: The Jews in Israel are not our enemies. The Hindus in India are not our enemies. The Qadyanis and the Christians are not the people who are creating an imbalance in a perfectly balanced nature. These people are just that, people. Some of them are good. Some of them are not so good. But to be honest, they are not your enemy.\np: The big house round the corner, the great bold ranks, the decorated offices, lawns and courtyards. The people who are building these places are a fraction of our society. These people try to control most of our life. But inside, they are just that, small. They fear losing their hard earned reputation and they fear putting it all at risk. They fear celebrating life and they tell us our dreams are not good enough.\nh3: The problem begins\nimg: direction1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Direction by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@jannerboy62 target=_blank>Nick Fewings</a>\np: People who have accumulated good wealths, are not bad people. They have done hard work. They tried to stand out in their competitions. They proved their worth and finally made it to a place where they are given an easier chunk to live.\np: In the hard work, they lost the pure color, charisma and liveliness of their life. As they worked hard, they sidewise prepared a massive chunk of misery to look at. More they look at their hard work, more they feel fearful of losing its rewards thus more they act stupid. The rich people, who have been rewarded with a good rank, after hard work, hate the hard work and doesn’t want to relive any of their effort.\np: As they excel further, accumulate more, gather safety and win confidence. They become smaller inside. Each passing day, more shackles, chains and fear over runs them. Fears like; one more day of hard work will give them an extra 100. One more month of hard work will give them the next rank. In an effort of proving their worth, they accumulated only one thing, fear of losing it all. After a life time of hard work, I believe it is not a good trade off.\nh3: Becoming the Enemy\nimg: box1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Box by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@kelli_mcclintock target=_blank>Kelli McClintock</a>\np: A person doesn’t want to lose his wealth. A person has become coward inside. Small and low. He slowly and gradually has been knocked down so hard, he doesn’t want to get back up on his feet. He doesn’t want the kids live riskier / play adventurous. He while building a safe heaven, enchained himself, locked his freedom up and threw away the keys in a dark place. He doesn’t want to live again.\np: The transformation, love for luxury, safety and further excelling, dulls down the over all personality. It creates a distorted human being. A person who is no more careful of his sub-ordinates. Some one who doesn’t fight for his people. A person who stops thinking out of the box. Becomes someone who is incapable of dining with his servants. Becomes incapacitated to build an equal size house for his subordinates. Becomes enchained to give up his wealth and fight for the poor in his people. He becomes, inhumane, ignorant and just that, a pride filled self righteous goon.\nh3: Fighting Him\nimg: fight1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Fight by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@attentieattentie target=_blank>Attentie Attentie</a>\np: You want your dreams go pure? They are not distorted? They are kept complete? They are honoured and encouraged? You reach them sooner? You succeed and you feel fulfilled?\np: You fight. You do not fight the Christian of Britain, the Jew of Israel, the Hindu of India. You do not fight good people who feel bad about their poor. You find your spine, that stands un-shattered, un-nerving and un-backed, against your real enemy. The rich, the rank, the holder of the bigger house, the ruiner of poor’s luxury and the spoiler of your dream. Only after you fight your real enemy, you will make your Islam complete. You will be able to make your Prophet pride. And your Allah happy.\np: Only after, you stand for your poor, your broken, your hurt and your damaged people, you can bring back the lost balance in your society. Only after, you start speaking truth louder, blunt and to-the-point, you will manage to defeat these enemies. Only after, you stand straight, wide and high, you will keep your dreams protected.",

Do Not!\nh3: Act\nimg.width-m-half: typewriter.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Typewriter by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@milkovi target=_blank>MILKOVÍ</a>\np: This is more difficult, harder and heavier on your health. Acting and making a point is hard work. More difficult than earning bread for your family. More pushing than preparing for exams. More testing your nerves than most selfish acts.\np: The act, and making it meaningful, needs your selflessness. Any selfish act, the position, the rank, the wealth, never makes a point lasting long enough to really make a dent in your life’s span. People who walk a life for personal gains usually end up in crazy mesh of talks, noise and cribs.\np: Be selfless, walk straight, talk no more, run, hit, fall and fail. Let it all come attacking you down. You get defeated. You lose your job, in this fight. You lose you car, in this run. You lose your life, defending your purpose. And when you lose it all, say these words; “I will not Stop.”\np: The words will scratch “logic” off your words. It will not be butter coated, temporary, momentous or life less. It will not be low in tone. It will not be same plain old rotten whim. It will be a mirror to your life time of struggle. People will hang it up on their walls, find the meaning of your life, feel inspired and make your purpose a reality / a goal / an end for you. They will die for you, after your death. They will print your quote with your photo in the background.\np: People will respect your words.\nh3: Die\nimg: grass.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Grass by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@milkovi target=_blank>MILKOVÍ</a>\np: I used to think, with out dying for your purpose, you can still hit your goals. You can still reach your destination. You can still find a burning desire inside you. But more I read people like Napoleon Bonaparte or Gandhi or Churchill, the more I find myself wrong. These people died for their purpose. At a young age, or an older age, they were willing to die for their goals.\np: Honestly, I am not yet willing to die for the purpose. At least, I find it fearful. I find bad thinking; I will lose my job, or car, or my laptop. I find, I am not yet ready to die for my purpose.\np: As I push it all forward, in open, at stake, on fire and open to judgment. I find, the zeal, the passion, the love. The sentences become structured. The body becomes obligated. The eye lines, the fingers and the wrinkles on face, speak only 1 thing, <b>I will die, but I will not give up</b>. If you don’t bring it on, the willingness to die for your purpose, you really feel lifeless.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: simple.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Simple by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@milkovi target=_blank>MILKOVÍ</a>\np: I am wrong, not brave, not crazy and not hard working. I am just that, some bones and flesh. I don’t find courage to run faster. I don’t find charisma to hit harder. I don’t find motives to fail longer. I don’t yet find the life, the fire, to make my life the way, I see my purpose.\np: These are talks. These hardly matter. These words do not carry a value. On the outside, this is a 129 day streak. A brand pushing forward. A conference coming up. On the envelop it is nothing, but part of an action. Inside, the meat, is not tasty, fruitful and helpful. Inside, it is just words and talks. These blogs are just that, words.\np: I say, stop talking, focus on your goal, walk this patchy road to lose chunks, the patches and the ornaments off your body. Walk this road, where you are snubbed, attacked, punched and ridiculed, and you do not talk. Walk this road, with patience, with love and with your life on the line. That your slight whims, breaths and sweats are heard carefully. Attentively. Boldly. And Bravely. ",

A profession, a house and quality drinks in my kitchen. A road, a lawn, a community and a country. Justice, calmness and enrichment around me. A bus ride will show me valleys of Hunza, Gilget and Baltistan [Northern Pakistan]. I have money, freedom and eyes. I can see good. Feel good. Talk good. Walk good. Fight good. And I can Love good. A 55 inch TV, a youtube and a Netflix at a touch’s reach. Life is good.\nh3: Let’s calculate the effort\nimg: rubber.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Rubber by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@imthaz target=_blank>Imthaz Ahamed</a>\np: It took a million years to invent rubber, put a mechanical gear beside it, attach a body, a staring and fix a body above this tire. The rubber invented in years takes me to discovering earth, never happened before in our timeline. One round trip of earth is really easy today. It might make me feel fulfilled.\np: It took nearly a lifetime of earth to bring electricity. The discovery of neutrons and protons. The flow of electrons inside a conductor. Generations of people worked hard to reach a point where we find a flat bed TV and a Netflix inside it. Humans fought, negated normalcy, sacrificed loved ones, conquered narratives and reached a place out of lawlessness, injustice and slavery to bring this comfort right in front of us. Consuming it all might make feel contented.\np: The world moulded itself. More I look back, roll pages, connect battles, read evolution, more I feel the world has become one good place to breathe. Already, life is abundant, beautiful and bright. Already, we have excess. Already, we are rich, wealthy and decorated. Already, I am eating fruits borne by my ancestors. Already, I have more than I deserve. The poor fighting for food out in the street to the ruler fighting for the next win, already have more than needed. The realisation of excess, might make them feel great.\nh3: Let’s calculate the Nature\nimg: cows.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Cows grazing by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@leonephraim target=_blank>Leon Ephraïm</a> from Netherlands\np: A close friend tells me, a mosquito is a complicated creature. It has eyes that can look all around. It is born in a pool of water. It comes out of an egg. It bites, to drink blood. It is a breathing vampire, that if flies at the speed of a fly, will turn this world into a chaos. We won’t be able to catch it. Our smashes won’t kill it. Our anger won’t hit it. If a mosquito gets it wings a little different, we will feel helpless.\np: We have crows that fly and sit. We have cows that graze and milks. We have horses riding for us. Portraits that encourage us. Movies that moves us. Books that make us smile. We have an abundant life outside our window, the green fields, the blue sky, the white clouds, the fading horizon, the metalled road and honking trucks.\nh3: You are not alone\nimg: beach.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Beach by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@leonephraim target=_blank>Leon Ephraïm</a> from Netherlands\np: If you are feeling alone today, do not worry, my dear brother, my dear sister. It is a part of life. We all feel alone sometimes. We all feel down sometimes. The sadness, helplessness and failures, are normal ingredients of a perfectly beautiful life. Hold on to the good small things around you. Hold on to your beautiful smile. While it seems it is falling apart, hold on to feeling grateful. Because, these incomplete patches are in fact means that guide you to an even prettier life.",

I want to stay humble and the only tool to continue this way is, become invincible.\nimg: sardinia.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sardinia by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@charlottevenema target=_blank>Charlotte Venema</a>\np: Moving forward on a single path is not easy. The self curated, self designed path towards success is hard. Walking is not difficult. But defending the meaning, purpose and your belief is hard. Critiques come your way, you stay humble is hard. Negativity rushes towards you, running faster is hard.\np: Let’s discuss the only way to counter critiques, doubt-filled questions and mocking comments.\np.b-left: 1. Become a good Listener\np.b-left: 2. Walk like a King\nh3: 1. Become a good listener\nimg: sane.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sane by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@dre0316 target=_blank>Andre Hunter</a>\np: You can never counter a critique with a better phrased / good enough answer. The criticism will never give up on beating you down. Your voice will get louder. Your face will show anger. Your aggressiveness and fighting this part of your life, will not earn you much. The gatherings of criticisms, negativity and un-ending questions never produce much. Negativity has only one corner that only questions others effort.\np: But you are different. You have a purpose. You started walking your own path. You do not have time, neither focus that you would want to waste here. You wasting your moments in these arenas of fake rings, will not bear you any fruit. Place it safe in your heart, “the gatherings of negativity do not move you forward”. Neither excel you. Nor give you a push. The negativity only spoils beautiful things.\np: The only way to counter negativity, is become a listener. The best in town. That never shakes, softens or splits. That never stops hearing. Just stays shut to all the negativity, criticism and pulls. Inside, you know, these people can’t hurt you, because you are stronger, better and beautiful.\nh2: Walk like a King\nimg: king.jpg\np.text-center.caption: King by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@lians target=_blank>Lians Jadan</a>\np: Pride is bad. Selfishness is bad. Anger is bad. Aggressiveness is bad. But bro, not here. Place where they exist, the negativity, the darkness, the falsehood, it is not bad. You walk like you are the king. You talk like you are the poet. You sing like you lead the winds. You act a Warrior, against all shuts, thuds and snubs. In the world of negativity, you act a Fierce Fighter.\np: Honestly, these fights lit you brighter. The glow on your face, the marks on your skin, the wrinkles on your head tell your struggle. You do not grow wisdom sitting in an Air Conditioned room. You do not grow guts sitting on a gifted chair or a bought out Freedom. You do not find courage sitting on somebody’s else’s throne. You do not win, unless you do not act King. Unless you do not snub them better, torn them sweeter and thrash them harder with your pride, you do not grow the pair to defend your purpose.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: defence.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Defence by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@lians target=_blank>Lians Jadan</a>\np: You are sweeter than honey. You are harder than metal. You are softer than cotton. You are ugly then fungus. You are bigger than life. You are a speck in the desert. You are one brave fighter against negativity. You are one beautiful meaning for the weak. You demolish darkness. You embrace love. You disgust Firowns. You crown broken. You jump into fire. You lit their desire. You are both ends of your life. One day ruthless the other day, love.\np: If you do not defend your purpose nobody will do it for you. If you do not stand for your mantra, no body will honor it for you. If you do not fight for yourself, nobody will fight for you. Be brave, courageous and bold. Be lively. Be beautiful. Be invincible that you protect your own dream. Be selfish that you win your own freedom. Be just that, a speck in the desert waiting for the wind to turn you into a storm. ",

If you are a fighter for the righteousness, beware, nobody is with you. You are going to fight your fight yourself. While fighting, getting the hits, you do not respond angry. You do not show emotions. When you fall, you do not complain.\np: If you are alone, going straight on your path, mind it, <b>you are going to find difficulties</b> and <b>you are going the right direction</b>. You will soon find Allah and you will not need the world, the relationships and the friends to hit your goals.

You knew it not, neither you nor your people, before this. So <b class=brown>be patient</b>; indeed, the <b class=brown>[best] outcome</b> is for the righteous. <br> - Surah Hud verse 49\np: These verses / surah was revealed in early Islamic days. While the Prophet (PBUH) was fighting with Quraysh to convince people of Allah. While he was shunned, thrashed, betrayed and disgusted, these verses were revealed to give him strength. Prophet (PBUH) became an army against falsehood. People who followed him became his columns. His companions were defending the ruthless attacks. They were dying protecting his message. Life for the people of truth had become difficult. Hope was dimming and agony was prevailing.\np: The sheer struggle is not only related to the life of Prophet (PBUH), only. It is as hard as it was Nuh (as) when people mocked him for preparing the ark. It is as hard as it was for Gandhi, Napoleon, Salah ud Din or Harun ur Rashid. Fighting for truth, standing like a wall for the weak, and going all-in alone, is not easy. People give up on you. They hunt you down and put their all into breaking you apart.\np: While Quraysh was beating muslims down. Allah (swt) gave muslims strength through Quran. People did not find hope, help or favor from fellow members of tribe, but built a spine to stand against falsehood alone. Allah was that power, who built their spines. Allah gave them courage. Allah increased their trust. Allah pulled them our of their troubles.\np: This has not changed. Over the course of history, while the mankind has negated the green leaf, the ant crawling, the crow calking, the thundering clouds, the tipping rain, it has not changed. People still believe in people helping them. They still believe their jobs will protect them. They still believe the world is for them to love, live and cheer.\np: This entire world, the entire lineage of relationships and great armies can not protect you. No power on earth will give you strength. If you are biased to the world more than Allah, you will not be able to fight a successful battle.\nh3: People are beautiful\nimg: sunset1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sunset by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@seefromthesky target=_blank>Ishan</a>\np: If you have Allah with you, you will find strength in people. They will love you, hold you, hug you, push you and motivate you towards your goal. They will become a part of your journey. They will bring glad tidings your way. They will give you hope. The people inside your home, to the people online, at job, on road will make you smile. You will find the innocence in them. The simplicity in them. The liveliness in them. And you will not be able to not love them.\np: None is bad. Pin it to your chest. No human is a bad human being. If they look bad, they are just a slight deviation, a slight detour or a slight dent. But these walking bones and flesh, are curated carefully. Their eyes, hair, finger nails and wrinkles are a universe-loaded machine. They are not ugly. People are not bad. They are good inside, deep in their heart, they love colors, light and calmness.\np: You do not heal fabrics until you throw your ego out the window. Your mind, energy and effort is meant to be used on yourself. Cure yourself, the world will fix itself for you. The people, already beautiful, will unveil their prettier side to you. It will all get better. Once you get better, it will all become one bright lamp, a source of energy, a lifetime of successes.",

I have pinned this advise to my heart. The more you talk in open, put yourself up for accountability, become vulnerable, more you become responsible. A lively lifestyle becomes a byproduct of your efforts. If your content is not accessible to the audience, you will never get the encouragement, and ultimately you will stop creating content.\np: <span class=circle>2</span> You gain trust. The more you talk about your own struggles, failures, life lessons, more trust comes your way. Trust bears fruits. It creates connections. Better social standing creates better brands. Your products are accepted as good products without any critique.\np: <span class=circle>3</span> It gives momentous joy. A feel that you are now going to succeed without a doubt. Your life has come back on the track. Your focus is back. This time, you will kill your goal better, quicker and bolder. It raises your confidence.\np: <span class=circle>4</span> You gain abundance. You get filled up with knowledge. You learn, formulate and connect dots. You rise in experience. You finally start sharing. And it leads to inspiring. Where, the most loved art in the world is, inspiring, you learn it sooner than those who have not yet made announcements.\nh3: What is in it for me?\nimg: imagination.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Imagination by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@isaacquesada target=_blank>Isaac Quesada</a>\np: I imagine, dream and stay lost in my goals. I want to reach there sooner than everyone else. Before I die, I want to make a dent. I want to live a rich life style. I want success, abundance and happiness.\np: I do not find it anywhere around me, but in Quran. Quran asks me to take risks. Quran asks me to write blogs and arrange dev conferences. Quran teaches a productive life style. Quran humbles me down. Quran asks me to paint, sketch, travel, create and live a life of freedom.\np: With Quran, we will build new schools, establish new meeting rooms and better co-working spaces. We will teach our children to code. We will bring our friends closer to rich history of Islam. We will ask them to say their 5 prayers, recite Quran, and connect to Allah during our developers conferences.\np: More muslims will unite, and it will become one united Islam. We will expand towards India, Bangal, Malaysia and Indonesia. On our west, we have Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Middle east. With this commitment we will become one united Ummah. And with unity, we will make a new Europe, a new Canada and a new California.\np: Imagine, these blogs becoming a state where you do not find many people who are poverty struck, hunger ridden or living a miserable life. The income, the churn, is flowing to the bottom of our society. We help people. People help us. And further in our life, we become a greater brand called as “Islam”.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: path.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Invisible Path by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@isaacquesada target=_blank>Isaac Quesada</a>\np: The goals are big, for this is what your goals are meant to be; big, unachievable, awkward. As you prepare your ride towards your goal, you become fierce. You start slow, but slowly you get louder. Gradually this awkwardness fades out. It brings in confusion. As confusion fades out and you are still running towards your goal, the realisation of your goals dives in. After realisation / acknowledgement of your weird goals as logical / normal ambitions, you are given your grounds the way you want them.\np: No more people label your dreams awkward, weird and stupid. No more they stop you. No more they doubt you. The insane voices, weird speeches and awkward talks in old days turn into sane, logical and inspiring examples. As you move towards your goal like an unbreakable wall, you start winning it all. You start crushing it all. You finally start controlling the ride to your goals like you are all in all.",

Stop criticising the tiny bits, the tiny imperfections in others.\np: Take a massive action instead. Channel your thoughts into meaningful work. Increase the flow of your blood to your heart, get it rushing faster. Get yourself to your goal quicker. Just get out of your comfort zone and do one thing right now. Do not fear the output, the results, the embarrassment and failures. Everyone fails. Most hide their failures and never succeed. Just go transparent, write a goal, share with your friends, community and fail. Get out of the fear of failure and start living your life to your fullest. Right now become a force that has an impact. An action that has an output. An example that has a meaning.

Don’t fail but enter the competition. Don’t stop.\np: You deserve wealth, luxury, power, charisma, fame and successes. You deserve it all. Just break your shackles, chains and fears. Just get out of your rules and principles. None can stop you from living, breathing and succeeding. You were born free. Nobody enchained you back then. Nobody can chain you today. And none will put barriers in your way in the future. Just get out, embrace life and enjoy the God gifted freedom you truly deserve. ",

This is a beautiful relationship and understanding its intricacies is important.\nimg: amsterdamiram.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: Amsterdam by <a href=https://www.twitter.com/punch__lines target=_blank>my wife ❤️</a>\np: You, the man, the flag bearer, are the honor of the house. You carry respect and you govern the principles. You are wisdom, knowledge and struggle that pushes the ride forward. You take the wheel, at times dodge obstacles and other times face them. But you are still not the manhood-ness, chauvinist and anti-feminist in the house. Still not the angry, fierce and loud member of the team. You still do not have a right to hit, hurt or pinch your family.\np: There is a dire need to maintain the balance. A need to take the responsibility. Let’s discuss these limits of men and women to lead a successful life.\np.b-left: 1. Limits of a Man\np.b-left: 2. Limits of a Woman\nh3: Limits of a Man\nimg: woodrings.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Natural Rings by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@theforestbirds target=_blank>Joel & Jasmin Førestbird</a>\np: Prophet (PBUH) had set a baseline of his life. He united his clan. Protected them. Fought for them. Stood beside his companions to keep their life’s easier, comfortable and full of life. In early days of Islam, while it was all chaotic, he found courage in Quran and his clan.\np: The Prophet (PBUH) has all the love to give to his companions, but never had allowed any of them to get into the defined boundaries of Islam. He never allowed anyone to break the declared principles that were needed to be kept intact.\np: We all men, need to have a baseline to maintain respectful relationships both inside and outside our clan. Follow these guidelines.\np: <span class=circle>1</span> Do not have varying boundaries for each in your family, friends and opponents. Your all limits are uniform, clear and easier to understand. You do not have a bigger circle ⭕️ for your wife, and a smaller circle for your mother. An easier life standard for your siblings but a difficult standard set for your friends. You talk to boss humble, and you talk to your subordinates louder. You do not have varying images of yourself. You have only one Uniform circle, can be bigger, smaller or moderate, for everyone in your life.\np: <span class=circle>2</span> Do not attack people who break these defined circle. Do not talk to them louder, angry or be disrespectful. You only need to tell them, remind them politely, soberly make them realize that they have entered the no-go area of your life. It is going to hurt them. Staying here longer will only cause them trouble. Still, you do not attack them.\np: <span class=circle>3</span> Attack when they stay here longer than it is possible. Longer they disrespect and forsake your boundaries, longer they build your momentum to get a stronger punch. And once you have punched them, it has to be felt to their roots. It has to set an example. It has to put fear into the hearts of people alike them, wanting to violate the limits. Like Badr, Qurayza, Hudaybia and Yarmook, the punch should be written down in the pages of history. It should set an ever lasting example of courage, bravery and strength.\nh3: Limits of a woman\nimg: roseonpaper.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Rose by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt target=_blank>Annie Spratt</a>\np: You thought only men were fighters? You thought only men wanted control? You thought only men were meant to rule? No. Women were built same, raised same and fought same. They are exactly like you, men. Same requirements and priorities.\np: There is a misunderstanding that Women are a little lower than men and they are a little behind than the “honorable kings” of our houses. They are powerful, beautiful, talented and analytical just like men.\np: The Quran and Sunnah wanted us to define our boundaries, act sober inside them and set examples for others to follow. We however thought these wantings of Quran are heavier and difficult to follow. Let’s define the women’s boundaries.\np: <span class=circle>1</span> They need surety, delight and stability. They want to feel respected. They need your love, wisdom and knowledge. They need to understand your plans to their minute details. They want to stand beside you, the first, in all ranks and fight beside you. They want you give them credit and honor their efforts. They need just that, your sincerity. As you give it to them, they become yours, fight for you and lead you to your brighter life.\np: <span class=circle>2</span> They need help. They want you to join them in kitchen, on walk, at job and home. They want you to cook them a meal 1 day and clean the drawing room another day. They don’t speak of it yet. They don’t call for help yet. They have better standards of lowering themselves than you. They need you around them, more than you need them around you. Find small things in your life, where you can stand beside your wife, and amplify them. That is how they look at things, which you take for granted. That is how you hurt them. And that is how you ruin your marriages.\np: <span class=circle>3</span> Your wife wants you to run the house. Overall she says, she wants the control. But inside, she respects a Man for being a Man. Who has principles, values and courage to stand strong to. They crave love of a good brave person. They want you to be their hero. They need you to make them feel elevated in gatherings, calls and isolation. They need you take control of everything in the house, build its foundation stronger and give them a respectable place to live in. They need peace and they want it flows in through you. That is how Prophet PBUH lived his life, humble, bold and transparent. We need to build our house on these lines as Prophet PBUH built his house.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: justice.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Justice by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@ashtonbingham target=_blank>Ashton Bingham</a>\np: You do not point your finger on others. You do not blame others for your problems. You do not declare a person the reason of your failures. This formula stands strong for your family as well. They are not your problem. If you are finding problems inside them, then believe me, you are the real problem. If you are finding it hard to run your marriage with stability, brother, you are the cause of this problem. You are not taking responsibility, not acting leader and not going humble. You can not, have not and yet not known, the meanings of the talks inside the heart of your wife. You do not yet know, she is evil, bad or disgusting. You do not yet know, she is more deserving for Paradise than you. You do not yet know how Allah will treat her on judgment day. If you are finding problems inside your wife today, believe me, you are going hay wire to the solutions of living a stable marriage life. Your wife is not the reason, you are the reason. Accept it. Live upto it. Take responsibility. And embrace your failures as your own. So that <b class=brown>you do not give up</b> on your clan.",

If it works, in’sha’Allah, it will fix the world.\nimg: frontpage.png\np.text-center.caption: Today’s view of <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com target=_blank>zakatlists</a>\np: I have seen people criticise politicians, rulers and scholars. Some labelling them too backward. Some being labelled “deserving” for hell fire. Most called with good names. And almost everyone is right. None of us is wrong. But to be honest, I am not content with the idea of “somebody else is wrong for the wrongs in my life”.\nh3.brown: Let's start\nimg: oldzakatlists.png\np.text-center.caption: Version 1.0 - <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com target=_blank>zakatlists</a>\np: Initially, I made zakatlists a fund raising platform, where people could come and donate funds directly to people. But I didn’t market it, my bad. And it failed.\np: Later, I took down the website due to financial crunch. I couldn’t afford its server fee and ended up closing this project (in November / December) last year.\np: That is past, and past is never a good place to live in. So let’s get out and discuss the <b>present</b> “zakatlists”.\np: Zakatlists is currently serving these things:-\np.b-left: 1. Motivational Blogs to boost productivity\np.b-left: 2. A simple Fund Raising place for your personal charity works / projects\np.b-left: 3. Monthly Tech Meetups to discuss real life struggles into building brands\np.b-left: 4. Courses [so far only for my university]\nh3: Motivational Blogs\nimg: firstblog.png\np.text-center.caption: First blog of <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/qurandaily target=_blank>zakatlists/quranDaily</a>\np: We are few friends, wake early up in the morning, take shower, perform ablution and rush to our central mosque. Say Fajr prayer. Sit in a side room, take out the mic, unwrap its cables, unhook the tripod, fix mobile aside, pin mic to our collar, take few friends online on whereby, sit in a circle and read Quran. We then unwrap the history, connect the dots and link life of Prophets with World’s Geography. At times Israelites shifted to Egypt. Other times Abu Ubaida fought plague and sometimes Napolean attacked Russia and failed. In a broader picture, we link Quran with everything in our lives and seek inspiration.\np: These blogs are our discussions turned into words intended to motivate people. That people break shackles, chains and get out of their dorms. That they start taking risks. Live brave and fight for their freedom.\np: So far, until today, the only lesson I have understood out of Quran / the world history / evolution of mankind is; People who jump into fire to defend their purpose, never lose, stand victorious and write beautiful stories.\np: So go ahead and subscribe to zakatlists for only 3 USD / month and read our blogs. <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/signup>Click here</a>\nh3: Fund Raising\nimg: fundraising.png\np.text-center.caption: Initial design of our fund raising page, check present page at <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/tickets target=_blank>zakatlists/tickets</a>\np: Go Fund Me, Buy Me A Coffee, Social Media timelines are all good places to raise funds. I will not say mine is better. I will say mine is human. It is just another place to raise funds for your projects or your charity works.\np.b-left: <span class=circle>1</span>  Almost all places ask you to Sign Up before making a donation or raising a donation. Zakatlists doesn’t ask you anything complex. It asks you to create a secret token to amend your donations as you grow. Just that, a password and you start raising funds.\np.b-left: <span class=circle>2</span> It doesn’t need you to have a credit card, a bank account or a mobile number. Even if you have zero credentials, it still will let you raise funds. Your donations will fall into zakatlists account, and stay safe here, until you provide your paypal account / bank account / mobile number or transferwise number. I will personally send you your donations without placing any cut.\np.b-left: <span class=circle>3</span> This fund raising doesn’t intend growing into a mega industry. It does want to beat the industries across the globe. But it wants to do it the Stay-Small way. It wants to prove Prophet PBUH lived the solution. He wanted to help people, in the core of his heart, and build them better. Zakatlists will work on these lines of our beautiful Prophet and build people’s lives better, until this world is fixed. Until none needs charity. Until you do not find a poor. Till then, zakatlists will put all its resources / employees / partners out there and bring your donations to poor’ door steps.\nh3: Techshek - Tech Meetups\nimg: chapter5.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Osamah Aldoaiss sharing his story to learning to code, check out his talk on <a href=https://youtu.be/nyVEpHFNLDQ target=_blank>youtube</a>\np: We have conducted 5 dev conferences till date. We have grown to 43 people who are building brands / fighting families and sharing failures. We are trying to remove the superficial curtain of “short cuts to success” and “easy way to make money” concepts. Some successful people join us once a month, share their struggles. They inspire us to build our brands and fail more often. With these people / our novice developers / some doctors and some engineers we are growing one step at a time.\np: You can checkout our brand page on <a href=https://meetup.com/techshek>meetup</a>.\nh3: Courses\nimg: school.png\np.text-center.caption: Courses offered at <a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/school target=_blank>zakatlists/school</a>\np: I am undergoing Masters in Software Engineering from Abasyn University Islamabad, Pakistan. I was missing deadlines and losing interest in my studies due to too much focus on zakatlists. Thus, I decided to bring my university into zakatlists as well. Embedded my university courses under zakatlists/school. Started reading everyday, and secured 1st position in my semester. Now my masters is going well.\np: I have not yet added outside courses. Currently I am building a course on Learning to Code at my Job. I plan to bring these courses into zakatlists soon. Some friends also have shown intent to share their courses on this platform. It needs a small Content Management System (CMS) for others to easily share their courses, which I am building on a side.\np: Subscribing to zakatlists will let you undergo these courses for a very nominal price of 3 USD / Month [<a href=https://www.zakatlists.com/signup>Sign Up Cost</a>].\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: innovation.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Innovation by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@mattwridley target=_blank>Matt Ridley</a>\np: Zakatlists is a reflection of my dreams / ideas and life. I want everything in my life. Money, Fame, Grace, Rank and Power. Without these dreams, my life turns meaningless. I find happiness this way. I find hope, love, charisma, style and a strength this way. Once I stop fighting for what is mine, I stop living.\np: I advise you to build one such brand against your name as well. Steve Jobs named it Apple. Bill Gates named it Microsoft. Zuckerburg named it Facebook. Quaid named it Pakistan. Muhammad named it Islam. Everyone, who lived, had a brand name, defending which they had put their entire life at stake. You should also build yourself a brand today. Buy a domain, write a blog, share your struggle on twitter / facebook / youtube. And live. This is 2020, times of internet, what is stopping you from living the true Freedom. Don’t think and Jump, Fall Fail Rise and Live!\np.note.end: If you find zakatlists interesting or you are tired of criticism, social pressure, negativity; you need company of people who pat you, encourage you and push you.

        "body": "h1: My idea of Mosque & Quran in year 2020\np.note: Yesterday after Isha prayer, we friends discussed the early days of Islam. We felt, the most modern religion / way of life in year 2020 is only Islam.\nimg: boulder.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Boulder United States by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@owen_was target=_blakn>Owen Wassell</a>\np: You want wealth, a sober income, a safe future, fun life today and a beautiful wife? Believe me, Islam is the solution. It is not at all labels, thuds and noise. Not boring books and lifeless lessons. Not a cleric standing on a podium and lecturing you to sleep. It is not what you see on youtube, in mosque and in Mecca. It is not a colorless religion. It is a beautiful way of life.\np: Let’s discuss Islam in its totality.\np.b-left: 1. Mosque is the source of light\np.b-left: 2.

It is hub of our culture, a source o light, a place to gather and discuss ideas. Let’s discuss 2020 revolving around a mosque built on these lines:-\np: <span class=circle>1</span> A big 12 x 10 Feet Video Wall hanging beside the cleric on a Friday Sermon. He starts with confidence, walks in front of the TV, tells people the map of Mecca, Madina, Hijaz, Libya, Palestine and Egypt. Briefly covers the life of Companions with red dots marked as pins on Silver-ly Google Maps. Gets louder as he walks the podium. Absorbs the attention. Grabs the motion of the lecture. A Friday sermon turns into a motivational lecture. As he sits after a 30 minutes speech, the entire audience feels pumped, rushed and pushed to take life changing measures in the following week, until another cleric briefs on this large Video Wall, standing beside a rostrum.\np: <span class=circle>2</span> The mosques have a corner where iMacs, Macbooks, iPads and Cameras are placed. This is a circular room like an Apple Store. 2 hours a cleric teaches JavaScript and the next 2 hours another cleric teaches “how to shoot good photos on DSLR”. Kids love this part of their mosque. They rush there during their hour of interest and imagine their future success.\np: <span class=circle>3</span> Another hall, a wide space, in a corner, handles marriages / social issues of widows, poor and weak. Where the lessons of courage are shared with our daughters to pull them out of man dominant goofy version of Islam. They find courage, love and freedom in this hall. They become riders of front lanes of our battles, kill their opponents and roar like Khawla Bint e Zarrar (ra). They become a walking symbol of pride.\np: <span class=circle>4</span> The TV in the mosque, 12 x 10 Ft wide, hanging in the center of the hall has a software that connects all the mosques in the world over internet. Software is showing rows of major society issues, being flagged by other mosques in the region. A poor in Karachi fails to fund his child’s education studying abroad in China, is flagged in his hometown mosque in Karachi. The red flag pops up across all the mosques. The TV watched 5 times a day by people of good hearts, will put in their all to fix these red flags. You will see the passion, the charisma, the grace and the style of Islam, with which people rush towards helping others. This child, receives donation in a click from Islamabad. The flag is resolved. No more people finding it hard to fund their children’s education. No more weak people in the outskirts of Myanmar. No more losses of wealth, health and power in Mumbai. One small villager in Bengal, is channeled strength through these mosques by an entire Unmah. This way our mosques will solve our society, the ugly version of Islam, and liberate us of our poverty.\nh3.b-left: Mosque of 624\nimg: greenwood.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Green Wood by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@dlanor_s target=_blank>Dlanor S</a>\np: The mosque in year 624 was our community center. We found hope here. The plan to fight the Quraysh here. We fixed our marriages sitting on its dusty floors. We found friends, leaders and mentors here. We found inspiration here. We were ruling hearts. Once we felt the pain of Prophet (PBUH), we glorified our mosques and turned them into libraries, laboratories and universities. We got out of poverty, built defence systems, road networks and welfare systems.\np: But, we moved our mosques out of hearts, streets and cities. We decorated them with better stones and bold sculptures. We made them a good place to take a good photograph. We turned them into a monument, that only looks good. As we took life out of our mosques, we lost the battle. The battle to fight poverty, failures and downs. The battle to find passion, love and glory. The battle to take the wheel and drive our homes to success. Today, in year 2020, we have deformed the shape of our mosques.\nh3: Quran is only Fun / Truth & Adventure\nimg: situ.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Situ Cileunca, Indonesia by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@azka_nurakli target=_blank>Azka Nurakli</a>\np: <span class=circle>1</span> Noah’s Ark was built in his life time (~ 850 years). People mocked him, ridiculed him and dragged him. He did not give up on some negative remarks.\np: <span class=circle>2</span> Musa stood in the court of Firown. Heard the drums, the loud chains and beats. Saw the strength of a king in all its might. He was a hardened wall against all the shelling, tanks and artillery.\np: <span class=circle>3</span> Prophet PBUH walked head down, focused and dedicated towards his goal. At times embraced criticism, other times felt the pits and mostly faced the wrath of the Meccans.\np: Quran is all these things. It is all about taking risks, acting adventurous and trusting your guts.\nh3.b-left: Take inspiration from Quran\np: Guys, if you want to succeed, become as ruthless as Nuah. If you want to crush your goals be as steadfast as Musa. If you want to live your life to your fullest, be as adventurous as Muhammad. It will let you carry yourself with style, grace and power. It will make you invincible. The crowd will love you. You will get money, the best house out there and above all, a life lasting sense of fulfilment. Following it, you will not break, have faith, not one day of your life, believe, no more depression, imagine, a life of colors.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: pratapgarh.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Pratapgarh, India by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@ronakjain target=_blank>Ronak Jain</a>\np: The google headquarters, facebook spaces and the apple stores are the real Islam. Clean, Humble, Uniform and Just. Where people talk ideas, builds products and serves humanity. Our mosques are these mega factories which were once google, facebook and apple stores of Muslims. We, the king, the soldier and the weak, stood together and built nations. We wrote scripts of the next block busters. We sat here happy, shared our meals and fought like good people. We spoke truth, kept Quran in our hearts and roared. Our war cries were loved, remembered and recorded. We ruled this life like kings. Through these mosques we liberated the ugly , dull , boring disgust out of our societies.\np: If you say Islam is not modern. You are saying it wrong. In fact, <b class=brown>the world is not modern enough</b> to understand Islam. ",

Let’s discuss basics of web development (Web APIs) and ways you can learn to code in 2020.\nimg: internet.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Motivation to code by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@herlifeinpixels target=_blank>Hannah Wei</a>\np: An API is called as Application Programming Interface (API). But that is a vast field to define software technology and goes out of our scope. We are limiting our today’s discussion to <b class=sign>web APIs</b>.\nh3: What is a Website?\np: A website is a page that is served to its <b class=sign>Client</b>. You are reading this blog on your computer. Your computer is the <b class=sign>Client</b> that is connected rearward to a <b class=sign>Server</b> over the internet.\nh3.b-left: Client Request\np.code: https://www.zakatlists.com/blogpost?ser=138\np.code.comment: // This is the current url / website link of this page.\np: As the <b class=sign>Client</b> makes the request over its browser, or say types above url in the url bar, it connects over a series of routers to the <b class=sign>Server</b>. For example, this website is deployed on Heroku Servers, in USA. So your computer has forwarded a request to the <b class=sign>Server</b> placed in USA seeking a response.\nh3.b-left: Server Response\ncode.code: <html>This is a blog I got from Heroku.</html>\np.code.comment: // Above is a dummy response you will recieve from server.\np: Heroku <b class=sign>Server</b> has responded over the internet to this query with an html document. HTML, hypertext Markup Language, is one kind of response received from Heroku <b class=sign>Server</b>. At times it is JSON, sometimes it is XML and other times it is a plain old text sentence telling you, server died 404, invalid URL or you are in the wrong territory.\nh3: Explanation\np: All the queries generated over internet, seeking a response from a <b class=sign>Server</b>, are functional due to <b class=sign>Web APIs</b> protocol. It is a procedure to send and receive data between world wide <b class=sign>Servers</b>.\np: In order to give you further clarity on the subject consider following demonstration.\nh3: An Example\np: We will ask zakatlists to give details about its developer using the following code.\nh3.b-left: Client Request\np.code: https://www.zakatlists.com/developer\np.code: <button class=submit onclick=ajax(`https://www.zakatlists.com/developer`,`p.code.response`)>Click here to Make a Request</button>\nh3.b-left: Server Response\np.code.response: [Response Text]\np.code.comment: // Here we will see a text response from the server\nh3.b-left: Another way\np: You can paste the url in your browser to see the <b class=sign>Server</b> response, <a href=developer target=_blank>Click here, If you are confused</a>.\nh3: Summary\np: A website is built over the internet. Internet transports your information between <b class=sign>Clients</b> and the <b class=sign>Servers</b>. <b class=sign>Client</b> is your computer. <b class=sign>Server</b>is somebody’s else’s computer installed with a slightly different set of instructions at another place.\np: We did not discuss <b class=sign>Server</b> side coding in this post. We will do it, some other day. But this post is your one baby step to understanding a vast and beautiful field of web development.\nh3: This is it\np: Now you are ready to start coding. You can pick one of the following courses that will guide you to creating content that is one click away from your family, friends and community.\np.b-left: Buy <a href=https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/ target=_blank>this course</a> on Udemy to understand basic web development by Rob Percieval. I started learning to code from this course.\np.b-left: If you already know basic web development, I highly recommend <a href=https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/ target=_blank>this course</a> on Udemy, to understand Web API development in Node JS.\np.b-left: If you can’t afford to buy yet, you can make use of <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/ target=_blank>w3schools</a> to understand all there is in the field of web development.\np: Please do not waste your time, pick one course, write good notes, 1 hour everyday after your morning ritual and start earning sitting at your home.",

        "body": "h1: 4 Days without Phone\np.note: Less mobile, minimum social media, relying more on news papers, cutting down lengthy talks and getting closer to nature, brings the real inside of we humans out.\niframe.w-75.d-block: https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hu4Yvq-g7_Y\np.text-center.caption: Ted Talk by Chris Bailey on youtube\np: I changed my routine 4 days back after watching above ted talk. After a bad day of excessive noise, near to little productivity, I wanted to get out of the noise and feel better. So, I decided no more using mobile phone longer than 30 minutes in a day.\np: What changed in previous 4 days after shutting down my phone? Let’s discuss.\np.b-left: 1. You get bigger blocks of time\np.b-left: 2. Curiosity humbles you down\nh3: Time\nimg: productivity.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Productive by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@mattragland target=_blank>Matt Ragland</a>\np: As soon as you switch the phone off, you start getting bored, upset and down inside. You start realising you were addictive. You feel without using it, you won’t find anything worth your attention. Life is dull and tick tock of this wall clock in front of me, is irritating. Phones were only making noise in your head; the noise that you realise only after you turn your phone / tv / news off.\np: Time comes in abundance. I recently took 2 freelance gigs and an ample amount of time to work on them. I have already published one gig in nearly 5 hours after receiving it.\np: In 4 days, boredom is bringing me money and time. Where people say, time is money, honestly, it is wrong. Money is Money. If your saved time doesn’t earn you anything tangible / a sense of achievement, time is not worth it. Until you get meaningful gigs out of your saved time, you really haven’t saved much time. These gigs, that earn you money,  pushes you far better than motivational lectures and costly books. I would say, Money is money.\nh3: Curiosity humbles you down\nimg: curious.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Curious by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: With phone switched off, a curiosity develops. Did my bid went through? Did I get any new customers? Did my social media post hit a heart? Did yesterday’s content go viral? Did anyone send me any donations?\np: The good thing is, you do not get an answer to these questions until you hook yourself back to the internet. Until you switch your phone back on, you do not get a hint of the outside world. This leads to more curiosity and curiosity transforms your day into more hope, expectations and cheerfulness.\np: The night, when you switch it back on for 30 minutes, you come across all the good news together. Some have sent donations. Some have acknowledged the gig. Some shared your blog post. Some showed some love. And it all together, makes you feel great, once again.\np: Earlier, you were getting all these tid bits in patches; distributed and un-organised. You were not feeling the blessing of one good donation underneath. But all the donations, tidings and encouragements together in 30 minutes, makes you want to jump with joy. Boosts your happiness levels and directly impacts your next day’s performance.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: donot.jpg\np.text-center.caption: ‘Do not’ by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: I say, do not talk, write and cheer. Do not work harder. Do not undergo a miserable routine. Do not fight what lowers you down. Do not put extra burden on your health, brain and life. Do not pass extra exams, extra assignments and earn out standing reports. Do not hurt yourself with unnecessary burden.\np: There is already ample noise, a-lot hatred, mess and traffic in your life. Do not put an extra door to welcome more noise your way. Turn off your phone, WhatsApp, twitter, facebook and TV; things with broken information. Reduce it to 30 minutes, if you must.\np: Get closer to morning walks, bird chirps, honest in-person gatherings and boredom. Live one day without your phone, and you will find, it was all green, quiet and beautiful. You will know; you were searching it all at all the wrong places. You will find, it was just outside the door, the trees, quietness and happiness.\np.note.end: zakatlists is launching on Product Hunt in 5 days.

        "body": "h1: Story of Yousaf (as)\np.note: Everyone has read it. Everyone loved it. It is a story of heroism, love and fight through thicks and thins. A story that elevated Quran over other books, quenched Arabs’ thirst and proved Muhammed is indeed the last Prophet.\nimg: egypt.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Al Ahram, Giza Governorate, Egypt by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@8moments target=_blank>Simon Berger<a>\np: Ibrahim, fought his father, built kaaba, changed the world’s future and moved an entire ummah. 2 generations down, his grand son, Yaqub, was blessed with Yousaf. All was fine. The cattle, farms, income and economy. Less troubles and more calmness. Until, Yousaf see a dream of 11 x stars with sun and moon, prostrating him.\np: Yousaf had good understanding with his father. So good, he instead of narrating the dream to his mother, sought advise of his father.\np: Father, Yaqub (as), the head of the clan, had a nice and sober persona. Neither angry, nor emotional. Neither dull, nor weird. Just there, in between the colors and maturity. Maintaining a nice balance to raise a sane child.\nh3: Story begins\nimg: rigid.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Rigid by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@cbarbalis target=_blank>Chris Barbalis</a>\np: Yousaf and Bin Yamin, were these step brothers who wanted a normal life. Always set aside, neglected by their elder brothers, wanted to win their trust. But brothers, jealous inside never let Yousaf near them. Bin Yamin out of their life, they had their own goals, ambitions and dreams. The elder brothers of the clan did not like their father loving Yousaf or Bin Yamin. Yousaf, to be precise, was the lynchpin in their struggles.\np: One day these brothers make a concrete plan to get rid of their father’s most beloved son. All brothers ask their father, Yaqub, to let Yousaf go out with them. Father denies. They insist. He agrees. Allows the piece of his heart get away from him. Knowing, it is Allah’s will.\nh3: The Well\nimg: well.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Well by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@salty_morning target=_blank>Maria Krasnova</a>\np: Everyone prepares bags, the tents, the woods and ration. The brothers, in the land of Palestine, move out of their homes, convinced they will get rid of the problem. Convinced they will kill Yousaf. Convinced their life will get back on track. One hurdle, after it gets aside, they will be back to living in riches, comfort and luxury.\np: The Allah, has always a plan. The better, unique and beautiful. He doesn’t let a pack of wolf hurt His people. He doesn’t let some dozen or some hundred dozen eat away the life out of His loved ones. He doesn’t leave His people out in the wild, unprotected and vulnerable. He always helps them.\np: As the brothers, prepare the attack, take out the knives and sharpen them. As they find the easy way, the small way, they start finding complexities hidden underneath their “simple” plan.\np: Such is they way satan works. Convinces you, corrupt life is easy, but as you near the actions, it weakens your legs, shakes inside you up and betrays you.\np: The brothers, angry and full of hatred are still evil. Filled with darkness. Can’t find a way to act upon any thing they promise. They end up going the easy way; drop Yousaf inside the well. No they don’t throw him into the well. They fasten a rope to a bucket, put Yousaf inside and slowly lower it. Gradually until it reaches the bottom.\nh3: Confession\nimg: confession.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Confession by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@maxmuselmann target=_blank>Max Muselmann</a>\np: The weak minds, never committed much crimes, from the house of a Prophet, can’t run away from the guilt. They can’t tell good lies after a murder. Because they have never committed a crime more heinous.  They still have a lively soul inside them. Something stops them from telling their father, the evil story with the zeal of truth.\np: Brothers bring the blood soaked shirt of Yousaf to the house. Not blood, but painted with red color. Fully intact. Not torn, not wrinkled, not messy. Just a shirt with some paint. Brothers, proclaim, Yousaf got eaten alive by a wolf.\np: Father, looks at the shirt, at the brothers, and inside him melts away. He knows this is a lie. He knows Yousaf is not eaten by a wolf. He knows, the shirt is not war torn. He knows, wolf doesn’t eat and spare the shirt aside. He knows, these are lies. But this doesn’t cure anything. If not eaten by a wolf, if 9 brothers are telling a lie, it still speaks; it is a war on the house of the Prophet. The aged father can’t argue with his grown sons. He can’t go out to find Yousaf. He can’t understand the torn away patches of the story. He can’t find contentment, comfort or a hope. Inside him, a part of him, dies with the loss of Yousaf.\nh3: Yousaf Gains Momentum\nimg: desert2.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Desert by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@makenna_entrikin target=_blank>Makenna Entrikin</a>\np: The dream of stars, suns and moon doesn’t give him a momentum. The brothers throwing him into the well doesn’t give him a courage. He stays there inside, 3 x days in a row, protected and safe. Allah feeds him. Gives him a hope. Tells him, the journey begins from here. The momentum takes its rolling from here.\np: A clan, some carts and few people, on their way to Egypt, halt near the well. Approach it. Lower their bucket inside. Look down. Finds a child / a teen sitting inside. Humble. Poor. Broken yet Alive. Hooting begins. Some laugh. Some winks and some hope arises among the travellers. They will sale it out. Earn some money from it. They will feed their hunger and ... they won’t look farther.\np: Allah, brings Yousaf out of the well. Gives him good food to eat. A new sense of freedom. In the people tapping wood, striking pelts and making jokes, he finds his new home. Ample life, to once again join the ride of this life. 3 days in well, and back on the cross roads of a confusing yet beloved life.\nh3: First Price\nimg: coins.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Coins by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@syhussaini target=_blank>Syed Hussaini</a>\np: The clan takes Yousaf to the Minister of Egypt. Some among people / historians have given him a name. But Allah labels this chieftain, a Malik.\np: Malik puts good money on Yousaf. This servant is handsome, humble and graceful. He is not just white skin and long height. He is some talk, some poetry and some verses. The Malik, the educated, the experienced, finds value. Not exactly. Not the real value. Gets a small glimpse of the creation of Allah, in His people, in the form of goodness in Yousaf. He finds a human, the miracle.\np: Malik, gives Yousaf far more than he had in Palestine. More to eat, wear and control. More responsibility and more wealth. Slowly the building momentum, the rolling life of Yousaf, starts wearing its ornaments. Slowly, Gradually, Allah crowns Yousaf with more, invisible to people who hated him, opposed him and rejected him.\nh3: A Soft Sin\nimg: dark.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Dark by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@karsten_wuerth target=_blank>Karsten Wurth</a>\np: The wife wants to know Yousaf. She can’t resist the grace, humility and maturity of a person who loves Allah. She can’t convince herself, neither manage to explore, nor find what is inside the heart of Yousaf. Curiosity first step, enforcement next step, misery third step and sin, the final step, gets the wife of Malik to attack Yousaf with everything she has.\np: Such is the way of Allah. He elevates his people. Puts the wealths, the excess, the freedom in front of His people, the people who love Him, yet they crave none of it. They still crave Allah, His love and His presence.\np: Zulaikha, or say a name, the wife of the Malik, fails yet again. The love for Yousaf increases in folds of 10s and 100s. He is more respected. As he, Yousaf, accepts life in prison over a life of filth with the wife of his owner, people fall down for him. The women, the weak and the riches, all discover a portion inside their hearts, they didn’t know existed. They discover respect for the guilty, damaged and the weak, Yousaf (as).\nh3: Prison Cell\nimg: cell.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Cell by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@redaquamedia target=_blank>Denny Muller</a>\np: Yousaf, was not a brave person. He was not a man of enormous strengths. He was just a man. He never wanted he goes to a prison. He never wanted he is thrown into the well. He never wanted his brothers snub him, push him or betray him. His thuds and falls never was his choice. It all came upon him to grow him stronger.\np: He did not commit a crime. He did not attack the wife of Malik. He did not do any of the wrongs. Yet he ends up in the prison. The Malik, the power, wants to stay afloat. It doesn’t want people questioning it. It doesn’t want people blame it. It wants to stay protected inside its palace, behind the lanes of the guards and above the heads of the weak. It doesn’t want to give up its luxury over the freedom of Yousaf. The palaces, that have never stood for the weak in this world, yet again betrays and weak suffers. Yet again, Yousaf is given the prison cell and Malik and Zulaikha continuous their life in riches.\nh3: Bloody Dinner\nimg: dinner.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Dinner by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@stephaniemccabe target=_blank>Stephanie McCabe</a>\np: I have seen Games of Thrones. The Starks are butchered on the dining tables. The mother, the sister and the daughter, who doesn’t carry much value, because they have lost their king, their realm and their fighting Son to the North, they can’t live sober. It was a good show. A fake story. A bloody dinner. Let me tell you a story better than that.\np: The dining set boxes are opened. Zulaikha is cribbed and ridiculed. Behind her back she is labelled a sinner. The voices, the small whispers, seep into the palace and she can’t take it no more. The rugs open. The hooters are blown. Wives of these riches are called out to a dinner at the Malik’s palace. They find it Hospital-able, Loveable and Cheer-able. After all, they craved for more of everything their entire lives, they find it all meaningful.\np: Some wicked hearts, some greedy chests and some people in the palaces are sitting. In the palace they are waiting. The roof is lit bright. Waiters walking aside. Kids playing outside. Just another day of an expensive dinner.\np: The Malik’s wife hands over the knives to all the women siting in front. Brings Yousaf out. He is beautiful no doubt, bright no doubt, white skin no doubt, some blood, some flesh and some beautifully pinned bones, no doubt. But he is unique. He did not tell a lie. Never in his life. He did not show 2 faces. Never in his life. He did not have a greed. Never. He did not have the lust, the desire and the wickedness deep inside his heart, ever in his life. His uniqueness, the charisma of Bilal, the humility of Abu Bakr and the Roar of Umar, made him folds of a massive energy. People couldn’t handle one Ibrahim. They couldn’t handle one Ishaq. They ridiculed Abu Bakr, Abu Ubaida and Khalid. They did not have a heart to digest all the prophets, no not all of them, only half of them, at one dining night. They did not know, the beauty was not skin, bones and flesh, until that night. All the charisma, grace, humility and courage, packed inside Yousaf, made these women go blind.\np: No more they could see with their eyes. No more they could control their hands. No more they could live, away from the excesses of Allah, and boom 💥 there it goes. They cut down their hands. The ladies, some cry with pain, some falter with love and some bow down in truth. They make their pricey dining wet and bloody. It turns into a chaos. Some lie their unconscious and some fall there humbled. All accept the truth. All accept, it was not a fault of Malik’s wife, who offered herself to Yousaf. It was an abundance of blessings, which this world never knew existed, until this day of blood-loathed dinner.\nh3: The Drought\nimg: drought.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Elenite Beach, Elenite, Bulgaria by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@antonghost target=_blank>Anton Ivanchenko</a>\np: Yousaf ends up back in prison. Few more years of lockdown. Few more years of no more freedom. Two people find him sitting their in the corner. They find him interesting. One dies. One lives and far ahead, down this road, this the other one ends up in the King’s darbar (counsel).\np: The king see a dream; 7 weak cows eat 7 healthy cows. He sits confused, curious, wanting and searching. Asks his counsel of the meaning of the dream. One counselor, the one who met Yousaf in prison, informs the king of Yousaf and his ability. Yousaf is called to the palace. And he informs the king of 7 good years of harvesting good from across the lands and 7 years of drought that will eat away the land. Suggests saving more and planning more. The wisdom, charisma and grace of Yousaf, leads his life to becoming the Finance Minister of Egypt. Something it is.\np: Yousaf asks his people, to stop it. The lies, the ugliness, the boring routine at offices. He says, kill it. No more bad work or days of no-productivity. He changes the desks, the wall colors, the flooring and re-orientates a new sense of freedom to his people. The good work of Yousaf, the productive lifestyle of Yousaf, lets the king take more from him. He slowly paints the same color he had done at his office, in the parliament, in neighboring ministries and king’s palace. Unlike before, now the people, the lower and neglected are finding it easier to reach the government for help. Slowly the system is fixing itself. Slowly a lifeless, a wicked and a failed brat wasting his life in prison, takes over the kingdom and guides the ship to a more aggressive ocean of bigger storms and deadly waves. The boy, Yousaf, has now everything in its might, to fix the world, to live a new story.\np: 7 Years, egypt becomes one developed state. More prepared and more humble than ever to fight the next 7 years of drought.\nh3: A Guilty Brother\nimg: innocence.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Innocence by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@kellysikkema target=_blank>Kelly Sikkema</a>\np: Yaqub (as) was a good person. He always wanted good for his people. He wanted his children spread light in the world established by Ibrahim. He wanted they all become good traders, painters and writers. They all deliver Islam forward. They all speak truth and they all carry forward the work of Allah to the distant lands. He wanted to eliminate hunger and poverty from this world.\np: His kids, did not listen him. They did not give due heed to the message of Allah. They did not want to speak truth and they did not live a life Ibrahim would have wanted out of them.\np: As the drought has hit the states, the flourishing and the green lands. The children, the brothers of Yousaf, do not want to die of this drought. They do not want to act aggressive any more. Now, after the wrath of Allah has fallen upon the planet, they do not want to walk rude.\np: The brothers pack their bags once again, prepare their rides once again, but unlike before, with out Yousaf, without an intent to kill a Brother. This time, they pack it all, to quench their thirst by reaching out to the famous Minister of Finance in the distant lands of Egypt.\np: The herd, the pack, enters Egypt. Minsiter Yousaf, gets the news. He finds it good. The love of his brothers and the days his clan joins him, are finally here. No more prison cells, no more Zulaikha and no more life in well. Here on, it is all Yousaf, rolling pages and engraving a new story of love. He smiles, sitting at his throne, spreads peacefully along side.\np: The brothers, in trouble, reach Yousaf. Yousaf entertains them like just another person. Asks them to give the due credentials. Avoids here, talks there and gets his attention back to his brothers. One thing, pinches inside him, the youngest member of the tribe, Bin Yamin. Inquires about him, and the brothers did not bring him with them. Asks his brothers to go back and bring him along for they will be given ration only after they show Yousaf, Bin Yamin.\np: The brothers go back, pleads their father for Bin Yamin, gets the approval and brings him to Yousaf. As they are given their rations, Yousaf puts a hidden treasure inside the pack of Bin Yamin. You can do it if you love your brother. He then announces, the loss of the treasure and asks the guard of the state to bring the guilty to him. Guards open the bag of Bin Yamin, and brings him to Yousaf. The guilty will now stay with his brother.\nh3: Finale\nimg: peace3.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Peace by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@csoref target=_blank>Colton Duke</a>\np: Brothers of Yousaf had crippled. As Yousaf denied them Bin Yamin, they went in a void. All 9 x brothers feared worse from their father, Yaqub. They returned back from Egypt to Palestine, seeking a solution from their father.\np: They looked towards Yaqub in pain. They couldn’t want to give more pain to their father. He had already lost Yousaf, he did not want to lose Bin Yamin.\np: Little did they know, a Prophet has a heart, as giant as Ibrahim and Adam. A Prophet finds goodness in his failures. Their father, a Prophet, is a leader who does not give up on his children, his people and his enemies.\np: Brothers narrate story of losing Bin Yamin to Yaqub. Father asks his children to go back, act humble, use different gates, pay the surplus bounty and bring back Bin Yamin.\np: As they reach Yousaf. As they ask for Bin Yamin, Yousaf shakes them up with a pinching fact;\nquote: Do you know what you did with Yousaf and his brother when you were ignorant? <br> - Surah Yousaf verse 89\np: They did not know, it was Yousaf, until Yousaf himself asked them. Until he himself declared his brothers, “ignorant”, they did not know the difference between good and bad. The space between right and wrong. The line between clean and ugly. Until then, brothers only wanted one thing in their lives, <b class=brown>More</b>.\np: Yousaf forgives them. Gives them his own shirt. Asks them to take it to Yaqub. Put it on his eyes. It will bring back the lost sight and colorful life.\np: Brothers, take the shirt to their father. Yaqub waits hastily, in the vast emptiness for a river of life, about to be unveiled. He tells people, I can smell my lost Yousaf. I can find him once again. I can sense him nearing me. In the times of no phones, no wires and no connections; a father connects to his son’s approaching cloth. Not the bloody shirt, or a torn apart hope, but a real news of life, abundance and happiness.\np: The cloth, it is, that brings Yaqub back to life. No more tears. No more waitings. No more hoping for a good news. It is all in front. The entire clan, the mother, the father and the brothers move in a pack, towards Egypt. This pack of wolf, becomes a symbol of pride, discovers its identity; the truth and it moves.\np: Yousaf, makes his father and his mother sit on his throne. The dream he saw in his childhood finally turns into a reality. The brothers, the 11 stars of his dream, prostrate to him while he sits on his throne. The moon; the mother and the sun; the father, sit beside him on his throne. A life long journey encloses in a moment of time, completes a simple sentence and unites the clan.\np: The entire religion moved from the pits of darkness, the losses of life long hope and an enormous empty vessel of love to a whole new region. Egypt, marks for them beginning of a new life. Life where truth is louder, bolder and stronger. Where weak fights and pride hides. A life, where people unite, nations grow and ego whimpers. A new state, a new world order, the beginning of Islam and message of Allah all around.\np: Until, they died and we returned back to this world, looking for success, under its thick crust, rocky mountains and temporary ranks.",

        "body": "h1: Money vs Conscience\np.note: It is a difficult battle. As money becomes part of your methods, you want to stay safe of its affects.\nimg: 100bill.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Money by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@precondo target=_blank>Precondo CA</a>\np: I recently involved money into building zakatlists. Some people hired me for work. It felt strange and risky. Because, unlike before, now I will be held accountable for my mistakes.\np: Inside me, it felt great; people giving you money for your services. But broadly watching, it is more responsibility, focus and a fear of losing the client.\np: Let’s discuss how we can protect ourselves once money rolls into our brands.\np.b-left: 1. Do not hinder flow\np.b-left: 2. Walk humble\nh3: Do not hinder flow\nimg: rivers.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Qadisiyah, Baghdad, Iraq by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@nasa target=_blank>NASA</a>\np: The money in your life is like a river of water. The salary is not yours until your bank pays it to you. It is not yours after you pay your bills, rations and car repair. It comes in your wallet for a brief period of time, and flows out. Like water in river doesn’t stop, the money doesn’t stop in your wallet. It flows.\np: The money, saved over years of hard work, is again not yours. It is in the bank and bank is building bigger investments over your money. They know, you are never going to use a wallet big enough to keep entire savings inside it.\np: I say, let it flow like this. A client pays you, give it out to buy better ration, better car or a better laptop on the same day. Invest on your clothes, luxury and house. Let it get our of your wallet as soon as it reaches you. Today’s money if spent out today, will lift your life. You will soon have a better car, a better home and a better laptop.\np: If you start putting un-necessary focus on money, you will start finding it is impacting your life, productivity and content quality. More you throw it away from you, more it lowers its admiration and more it comes in abundance. The river, the wallet in your pocket, starts filling more often. And once the money earned today, exceeds the money needed today, you will find your life getting easier.\np: Make note, rich life only happens once your love of purpose exceeds your love for money.\np: Prophet PBUH told Abu Dharr once;\nquote: Abu Dharr, if the mountain of Uhud were turned into gold for me, I would not like three nights to pass and one diner still be left with me, excepting what I would leave for paying my debts. <br> - Sahih al Bukhari 6444\nh3: Walk humble\nimg: humble1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Flowers by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@henry_be target=_blank>Henry Be</a>\np: Money pollutes your mind, health and over all conscience. It is a bad thing to connect yourself to. But it is an important thing to skip the “fund raising”, “donation seeking”, “help me” part of your life. You feel bad asking for donations? “Earning money for what you are good at”, is the solution.\np: But it dulls you down. Breaks you step by step. Fills your head with calculations, plans and filthy dreams. It overcomes your personality and puts you in shackles. You get egoistic, aggressive and evil. Honestly, this is what money does to you; hurt, pain and losses.\np: Whatever happens, pin it to your chest, you will walk humble. Head down, eyes looking for mercy of Allah, burdened with troubles and aged. You do not grow wings, start a flight or grow more than what you are. You are a speck, that has no value and you will stay like this, until you die.\np: If humility, humbleness and love of purpose, is over shadowed with wanting of more money. You need to stop yourself. Take a halt in this run. Prostrate to Allah. Ask Him for guidance. And wait until you start feeling yourself, a speck, and get back on the track.\np: Without pinning these rules, you can’t produce quality. You can’t live productive. You can’t embrace freedom. You can’t succeed. Without humility you can’t fight.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: paradise.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Paradise by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@bantersnaps target=_blank>Banter snaps</a>\np: Life is small. It is 60 years. 30 years already spent. Some years left on this road. Why not live like a careless bird. Who leaves her nest, joins the herd, flies north, sits fights and gathers. Who feeds her kids with love, purity and nature. Why not live for one day, without thinking about tomorrow. Why not, graze gardens beside rivers, dive into waters and walk wet. Why not?\np: You need nothing in money. Things you need, you already have. You already have a nest, a tribe, a herd and some fields to graze. You have kids, you have mornings, you have the skies. You have wings. You can either fly today; careless, open and wide. Or you can wait, till you die.\np.note.end: zakatlists is launching on Product Hunt in 5 days.

It taught us few things, that we can hold tight to, until next Ramadan and succeed.\nimg: fun1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Fun by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@billow926 target=_blank>Billow 926</a>\np: I felt down, lazy and upset the entire day of Eid. There were countless messages and no phone calls. Countless wishes and no heart felt hugs. So much talks and no meanings. Inside we left each other a bit in our WhatsApp groups, talked each other down a bit and back bite each other a little. No not you, or that friend or my relative, I am telling you about me. I did not find honesty in my Eid wishes. Inside I felt bad for paying superficial homage, but above, on the surface, it was a fake smile, dodging arguments and hurting friends. Eid was not lived how I wanted it.\np: Let us lit 🔥 back the days of Ramadan everyday until next year’s Ramadan. Let us find the same mornings and same gatherings at night. Let us become the same tribe we were just 2 days before, the rest of the year. Until next Ramadan let us promise ourselves we will carry the ornaments of this blessed month of love, smiles and happiness over our heads like a jewel. Let us feel great once again and make these 2 promises:-\np.b-left: 1. Wake up for Fajar in time\np.b-left: 2. Do hard-work everyday\nh3: Wake Up Early\nimg: sunrise.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Sunrise by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@frankiefoto target=_blank>Frank Mckenna</a>\np: Fajr left us at 0350 hours. Here in Gujranwala, it has moved 25 minutes further late into the day. It was going fine, but now that we have hampered our day a little, let us stay committed to this new timing of 0415 hours. Everyday, let us make a promise, we will rise 30 minutes before Fajar. Take a good shower. Recite some, walk some and talk some. Let us start our day, with a smile and a vision.\np: It did not happen yesterday. I was late from Fajar. I felt the parts of me losing away from me. I was at loss. I ended up cribbing, hurting and pinching. The day, the 30 minutes of morning, impacted my entire life cycle. The missing of Fajar prayer timings, lead me to chaos and I did not find fire inside me.\np: Let us join hands, walk in a group, together, like a clan, and move to victory. Where we find more wealth, more life and more fun. The part we find missing today, let us move to it, everyday together. Let us push myself, yourself, others and bring us to our morning prayer. Before the rise of the sun, let us win it all. Let us quench our thirsts. Let us walk like a fighter, to our dreams, together like a band of brothers. Instead, we win it, let us take the promise. Let us become a moving momentum. Let us be the momin, the muslim, the lover and the fire, that heals the inside of us and conquers it all.\np: Make a promise starting today, that you will not miss your Fajar prayer until next Ramadan. One Promise and you will find it all fixed in a year.\nquote: People overestimate what they can do in an year.

Life is difficult this way. Without Ramadan and without the night prayers together, life is tough. It is getting out of your hands. Unlike Ramadan, time is going away. You are losing it today. Believe me, one more day wasted equals an entire Ramadan wasted. You won’t be able to make up to it. You won’t be able to find the same zeal, passion and love; you found in this month. If you stop, today, you will not get back on track tomorrow. Get back up on your feet. Get back up, moving. Get back up, running and hunting the weak, the poor and the troubled. Gat back up, to roll yourself out, like you rocked and rolled in the month of Ramadan.\np: Become a roar, once again. Become a song, that is loved, embraced and accepted once again. Let us get out, break the shackle and rule once again. This month will come back. You will find the abundance rolling back. Just don’t feel down. Just don’t argue long. Just don’t find the happiness where it doesn’t exist. Just stop there. Halt there. Look back. You just had the abundance. Few days down, you will have it all. If you do not give up, you will find it all under your feet, beside you and around you. The wealth, the money, the charisma, the grace of Prophet, inside your heart, if you live like you lived in the month of Ramadan.\np: Let us make a promise, we will work hard. Harder than ever. We will keep our phones from hampering our work. We will keep the noise of the TV from hurting our streaks. We will keep the people from lowering us down. And we will not look up, until we have done the hardwork due for the day. Let us make this promise and live towards a guy, you see in yourself who is driving this expensive car to a beautiful home and a lovely wife.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: launchpad.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Launch Pad by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@olav_tvedt target=_blank>Olav Tvedt</a>\np: This is the same day. Same sun. Same birds and same chirps. Everything is same. You have everything available to you like it did yesterday. Nothing has changed. If you did not take a jump yesterday, it will not change today. Take the jump today. If you did not find happiness yesterday, crave it starting today. If you missed on your goals yesterday, crush your goals today. If you failed yesterday, hit success today. Rock, like a rockstar. Roll like a moving stone. Gain the momentum. Jump and get hurt. Talk and fail. Launch and feel ugly. Act and repent. But do something that moves you today. Do something that saves you from another pit, another thud and another day of living a lazy day.",

Please friends, connect to Allah, He is beautiful, merciful and loving. He will make zakatlists famous and only He will make you a loyal customer of this product.\nimg: landscape.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Landscape by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@trails target=_blank>Trail</a>\np: Even if you do not believe. You do not trust their is a God. You do not find Him around you. You do not see Him. You can’t believe. Even then, what bad does believing bring to you?\np: I am a believer not because I have seen Allah out in open. Or I have finally got that realisation-bolt. Not because I can see Allah always around Him. I am a believer because, Allah asks nothing from me, except truth, helping others, sharing with neighbours and living a good life. Only that; become a good human being.\np: Today it is not promotion of zakatlists or asking you to go to computer and do some confusing ticks and taps to upvote this website. It is only 1 advice. Say your 5 x prayers everyday and recite Quran early in the morning.\nh3: Live Aggressive\nimg: aggressive.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Aggressive by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@chrissabor target=_blank>Chris Sabor</a>\np.b-left: If you are finding it hard to absorb a problem.

To fix it you are willing to lose all of your career / family and wealth.\np: If you are confused today, that you can’t find a simple solution to a problem. I say, be humble. Act sober. Live on the bottom. Be the punching bag. Get hunted and do not raise a voice.\np: This is too much to ask. To take the punches and not respond with not even a single punch. I know; it is difficult and bold. It is unlike Islam. It is unlike Prophets and their companions. Once they encountered a rich, wrecking a poor, they broke inside and they had all the energy , zeal and strength to crush the wickedness. But sometimes, very few times in their life, they acted humble to fix it.\nquote: O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient. <br> - Surah Baqarah Verse 153\np: You opt patience today. You got these hits yesterday and you are ready to hit back. Wait, hold on, sit down, drink some water. Say 2 nafal of prayer and have patience. Allah will provide for you better ways and means to fight these issues. He will give you and fight for you, through His forces, and give you a better reward. You will maintain your grace, you will have increased in repute and you will be loved more.\np: If you did not respond today to some jolts, punches and hurling stones, you will have more of everything you desire in your life.\nh3: Say your 5 Prayers : Read Quran\nimg: morningrise.jpg\np.text-center.caption: The morning sun rises over Isla del Carmen on a tranquil Sea of Cortez by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@chrissabor target=_blank>Chris Sabor</a>\np: Do not upvote, say me Eid Mubarak or give a kiss to my forehead. I am not annoyed, neither angry nor down. I am happy. Do not worry about me.\np: If you want me happy, say your 5 prayers and recite Quran. Or, text me, “you are not going fast enough”.\np: Your prayers and connection to Quran is more important than you worrying about me. I am not going to lose any of its rewards. Neither will lose a fraction. I will stand victorious tomorrow, if you are worried I will fail, let me assure you, I will not fail. I will succeed. A death can happen at most, still it is not a failure. A cell can bind me for a lifetime, still it is not a failure. Some people will go away from me, still not a failure.\np: I want to assure you, I am going good. You are my friend, if you tell me, “I am not going fast enough”. You are my well-wisher, if you ask me, “write 2 blogs instead of 1 everyday”, “arrange 2 meetups instead of 1 every month”, “say 6 prayers instead of 5”, “wake up at 3 AM instead of 5 AM”. You want to put a smile on my face? I say, do not worry about me. I say, “do 5 prayers and recite Quran every morning”.\np: Because this way, the reading Quran and saying prayers way, we will definitely cross our roads. We will surely meet. And we will surely have a heart ❤️ filled with love for each other in this life, on our death and the day we are resurrected.\np.note.end: Zakatlists is a welfare platform.

The TV, the crib, the lengthy phone messages, the arguments and un-necessary discussions. These do not mean anything to you. You might lose a leg, a hand or your life on these meaningless roads, but still they won’t bear you much fruits. You won’t find contentment walking these paths of other people, or your parents or your bosses. You won’t feel great on these roads.\np: Let’s discuss how can we cement our own Pathways and walk them with courage, inner fulfilment and determination.\np.b-left: 1.

If you are humiliated and you feel ok. If you are snubbed and you feel it is just another day. You are a loser, a willing member of your group, who is not afraid of losing reputation, arguments and discussions. Because these do not mean a dime to you.\np: You have your own road, to lay. Your own path to clay. Your own road to build. You have your own direction, your own motion and your own passion. They, the people who pull you, drag you or punch you, are not a part of your team. They are meaningless and un-necessary noise on the road you are not walking. Avoid them. Lose them. And do not worry about them.\np: Be a willing fighter who feels great not when he grabs a glorious cup in a crowd. You do not find happiness when they clap for you. You do not cheer up when they appreciate you.\np: Be a willing loser. Who feels great when they attack you. Who feels a life inside, when they punch you on your face. When you are show resistance, humiliation and dejection, you act a wall of steel, that stand there; fearless, brave and bold. All willing to lose.\np: For losses on this road, where you do not belong, are just a noise to your head. Just that, a disgust. Avoid victories here. Be a loser here. This road, the metalled, leading to glittering golds, is just a diversion in your life. You belong into the wilds, in the woods, along the horses and the greens. This is not your city, not your town, not your road and not where you roar.\nh3: Do not count Favours\nimg: no.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Girl power by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@joshuaearle target=_blank>Isaiah Rustad</a>\np: Did they raise you to a good human being? Did they fund your childhood? Did they buy you a car? Did they give you birth? Did they died fighting for you?\np: They are your well wishers. They did not sell you out. They need to be told, they do not own you. They did not bring you any good. If they counted you the favours they have done for you, take out the favours and throw them to their face. Make them realise you do not have the ability to pay them back. To return them the same. Or you do not want to ever talk to them.\np: You do not burden yourself with other people’s favour. You do not carry a bag where you are keeping a record of what is left to be repaid. You do not focus on what is not important. You do not let your body take the toll, returning the indebted favours, greetings and blessings. They did it for you, wrong! If they gave you a count of their favours, they in fact did not do it for you.\np: Shed it away. Get out of this chain. Break this barrier. I say, run away, to a vast emptiness beside a sea and enjoy the sun set. I say, get out, stop thinking about people, your loved ones and people who put a stopping in your life. I say, let them miss you a little, feel bad about the betrayal a little and you take the jump. You get out, find your path, walk there, head down, with passion and love. These people, they who have done you favours, they do not mean anything in your life, if they are stopping you from taking the flight.\np: Take the hit of reality my brother, embrace it. People do not care you lose or win, they only care how you respect them, benefit them or reward them. And if you really care about these people, explore better rewards, better ways and bigger part of untouched part of your life; to give it all back to them. Get out, get uncomfortable and get moving. This is the only way, you can cheer them up, lift them up and reward them. This way, walking-your-own-path way, you will find more to return.",

You always knew all of it, except you never dared to explore, discover and ask yourself for more.",

A fear looms over my head and I feel, “I am not ready yet”.\np: Everyday, ask yourself these 3 x questions. Everyday, prepare. Make notes. Write plans. Buy a white board and paint on it “how you wanted your life to become”. Do something difficult everyday. One day no AC in home, one day walking on foot to my work, one day digging for plantation, one day writing an essay and one day travel into the forests to sit there for a night.\np: It helps. As you move towards your destination, things start becoming clear, easier to apprehend and you build courage to take bigger losses. These losses, as they appear in abundance, they build a shell of no-fear around you.\np: Walking this path, “building self reliance” way, You won’t feel bad jumping off the cliff into a river. Won’t feel rushed, jumping off a plane. Won’t think, won’t calculate, won’t hesitate; jumping into the fire.\np: You will become a wrinkled head, cracked feet and a black skin. War torn, spoiled and hardened. Something, beautiful, delicate, and graceful.\np: Honestly, this is how you find the true nature of all the Prophets. They all were humans; Hardworking who had Experienced losses. Took hits. If you want to learn how you can too lose, you too can absorb tornadoes and you too evolve into a walking mass of energy;\nP: Follow any of these humans:-\np: Muhammad, Musa, Ibrahim, Noah, Adam, Yousaf, Yaqub, Ismail, Isa, Saleh, Daud and you will learn “how to lose”.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: light1.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Light by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@williamdaigneault target=_blank>William Daigneault</a>\np: A muslim is not someone who “says” / so-called “believes” Muhammad is the last Prophet of Allah. But fails to absorb this reality. Goes back to lies, snatching rights, hurting poor, littering and snubbing the weak. This person is not Muslim; but A worse kind, the lowest kind of humans.\np: You are a muslim, only if you speak truth even when you know you will lose. You take the hit, even when you know you will break. You fight for poor, even when you know you will lose your car, your mother or your freedom. You only become a good person, a muslim or a success; after you take the hits and smile.\np: Point is. If you followed your desires today, it doesn’t matter what you narrate; a kalma, a slogan or Quran, you will not be able to win. Not here. Not there. You will always stand a loser.",

Please, follow it through. It is not a blog. It is meant to take you to a brighter day tomorrow.\np: Sleep early tonight. 9 o clock. If it is Isha around this time. Sleep right after your night ritual. But sleep early. Put your life at stake. Your family, your job and your hobbies at stake; but sleep early.\np: Wake up 3:45 AM. Take shower. Some blossom. Wear your favorite dress. Put on your favorite perfume. And move. Slowly and gradually. Some Allah o Akbar and some Astaghfar. Head down. Remove your shoe. Step onto the floor. Feel the itchy cold on your feet. The slight breeze on your face. Join the clan. Say fajr. Submit. Drown. Believe. No more nights and no more days with out Allah. Absorb Fatiha. Breathe “Amen”. Heavy tone. Humble head. Forehead to the floor. Feel the angels. On your shoulders. Sit there, on naked floor, fan humming and birds chirping. Near the forest, out the window, feel the calmness a little. The quietness and comfort. Less of people and less of everything you had, the night before, and now you start feeling more.\np: Sitting here, plan your life. You wanted to become a designer. Go ahead think. You wanted to get rich. Go ahead explore. You wanted to travel North. Go ahead. Feel it. You wanted more? Go ahead, crave it.\np: Dive into this ocean of endless thoughts and planning. Sitting here, step by step, align the mazes of your life. Try to connect with your better future. What is it really thay you want. Ponder, think and plan. Your life, the way you want it.

Be the charisma, the motion, the pain and the strike, you saw inside you back in the mosque.\np: Jump. As you leave your mosque. Excited. As you start moving out. Fire. As you exit. Move and this time, do not stop.\np: You taste life. You live it. You get selfish. You enjoy it. You put your fire out in front and you become the charisma. Not your leader. Not your role model. You, you take the glide. You lead the ummah. You lead them and you win their Freedom.\np: Attacks. Pinches. Irritation. Thuds. Failures. It will come at you. Believe it, they will undermine you. Your fire. They will grab you from your collars. They will throw you to prison cells. They will call you bad names. They will hunt you. They will punch you. You will see it. And you, my bro, now the fire ridden flesh and metaled bones, can not stop.\np: The fire won’t let you take a halt. It won’t slow you. It won’t confuse you. It will give you peace of a soft spoken mother one day and it will give you a roar of a fierce lion the other day. You will become a story, a headline, an embarrassment and a failure. You will become the lowly. Honestly, you will be degraded. But have the faith, once you taste it, the fire, the formula of life, there is no stopping you.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: unity.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Unity by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@storginar target=_blank>Daniel Curran</a>\np: A good house.

This life of sobriety, comfort and ease, doesn’t help you.\np: If you want to live. Really want to lit the fire. That shakes you and doesn’t let you stop. Take the decision today. Sleep early tonight. Wake up early tomorrow. Plan your life in your Mosque. And re-enter your life with a new zeal, a new vision, a new purpose and a new mission.\np: If you feel, you are down tomorrow, after you jumped and you wanted to stop; give me a call. We will hold hands, share our struggles and keep each other afloat. Like a clan, a tribe, a group of companions of Prophet PBUH, we will unite, and we will push us forward to keep burning the fire inside.",

You do not need a boundary wall, a roof and a fan. You do not need the car park. You do not need the pathway and a store. Not sound system, not expensive power backup. You need none of it, to build a mosque. Indeed, Prophet PBUH, encouraged staying low and targeting the purpose through precise set of actions. As you target Value, you solve problems as its by product.\nquote: \"I see you building your <b class=brown>mosque</b> high after I am gone, just as the Jews built their <b class=brown>synagogues</b> high and the Christians built their <b class=brown>churches</b> high.\" <br> - Sunan Ibn e Majah 740\nh3: Let us Crib\nimg: cribbingcat.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Cribbing by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@hhh13 target=_blank>傅甬 华, Wuhan</a>\np: We ended up fighting for our rights, freedom and future. Neither Christians, the lofty ones, nor Jews the cruel one, not Muslims the hypocrite ones, focused on the actual meaning of Life. Instead of living normal, simple, humble and close to the nature, we went haywire defending our ego, wealth and children.\np: Every sane person, great enthusiast, successful businessman asked us to find our a purpose and defend it. We did not listen to the mentors, counsellors and advisors, instead, we built high rise buildings, larger gardens, sharper fences and un-breach-able borders. We did not defend the meaning of our lives, and started fighting over meaningless ornaments of life.\nh3: Kick your Ornamental Life Away\nimg: childkick.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Child Kick by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@johnny2491 target=_blank>Johnny Wall</a>\np: One Good Mosque, is not a good mosque because it has a floor and a small wall beside it. Not because it has green trees above it. Not because it is close to simplicity.\np: It is beautiful because its worth coincides with reality. While a poor struggles to feed outside the fence, the border, the line, I do not afford building a more luxurious mosque.\np: Until the mosque, the floor and the small wall, fulfils its purpose, you not find a reason to build a wall and a roof around it. Until the pain of poor inside you stays afloat, you do not find a reason to fight for decorations, beautifications and ornamentations of your mosque.\nh3: Feel Pain inside, Fix World Outside\nimg: pain01.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Pain by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@cristian_newman target=_blank>Cristian Newman</a>\np: If I fix my pain, the depth, the hunger and un-ending thirst inside me, I wont create a conflict.

The brick, the window and the door, will find its way back, but a damaged soul, a neglected child and a murdered black, will not find its way home.\np: Go humble, become the mosque, the Prophet wanted you to be, and honestly, you will lead just like Him. Just like Him you will conquer your own people, first, your enemies, next, and your purpose, last. If you remove curtains of hypocrisy and become the Gandhi, naked and transparent, You will build Madina of 633; the solution to Black Lives Matter, suffocated Kashmir or the broken happiness scale of your life.",

Your body is not built on self sufficient, isolated blocks that sustain on their own. Unlike an airplane, where wings carry the engine, belly carries the passenger and kitchen carries the meal, the body is non-modular.\np: You take the blood out, body dies. It ceases to exist and never recovers. It doesn’t get back to living. Unlike your refrigerator door, you are not able to put the blood back into the body and make it come back alive.\np: Understand the body, the structure, the flow of blood and its dependence on its neighbouring structures and you will realise Science is helpless in finding a solution / an answer to its brilliant posture.\np: If you look deep, the blood not only carries the food for the organisms of your body, it also carries messages, some first aid kits and some viruses. Science has not yet made a microscope that can look beyond a microbe. It is not powerful enough to cure the body and it has not yet found a solution to death. Honestly, science doesn’t have the ability to cure the body. It is helpless against nature / virus and ageing of microorganisms.\np: The solution lies not in science. Not in expertise. Not in labs. Not in research. Not in education. Not in books. It does not lie here, in the books or hard work or extensive amount of discipline. It is not here.\np: The solution to the problem, the virus, is courage.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Build Courage\nimg: woodland.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Life by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@szmigieldesign target=_blank>Lukasz Szmigiel</a>\np: Become poor, low, humble, sober and patient. Live close to the ground. Eat dirty. Live bad. And get ugly. Become a problem ridden goof. Become an un-disciplined and one miserable guy.\np: Do not rely on scientific methods. Do not listen to your doctor, elder or your mother. Do not live a successful person. Close your ears, go dead, blind and shut. Run away from the crowd.\np: Science has failed and your mother still believes in it. Science has lost the battle and your community still has a hope in it. Medicines and hospitals have become prison cells and your people are still labelling it the cure or say, a door back to the freedom.\np: These people are stupid, abnormal and retarded. Run away from them. Run away from logics. Run away into the woods. Run towards your desires, wishes and wantings. Run out and do not listen to science. Do not listen to media and do not read newspaper.",

Someone that herds, grazes and fights. Stands in a tribe. Roars with the soars. Become a walking, talking and snoring horse. Run. Jump and Neigh like a horse. Become a part of a tribe. A label. A brand. A name in your clan. Your village named after you. Your city talking after you. Your country taking pride in you. Become the animal, that is not alone, in a dorm, in front of a laptop, away from home. Not that, not human. Do not be human. Become an animal.\np: It affects you. Your lift quality. Your walk. Your talk. Your motives. Your job. Your profession. Your home. Name it. It is affected when you become social. You gain respect. You gain standing. You gain trust. You gain wealth. Name it. You gain it.\np: Pick up your phone. Call your distant relative. Talk your heart out. And then listen. <u class=line-red>Shut it down</u>. Throw it under the bed. Open the door. Knock at your neighbour’s door. Deliver a plate filled with gulab jaman / barfi / pakora or jalebi. Smile. Laugh. And say goodbye. <u class=line-red>Shut it down</u>. Ride your car. Run to your subordinate. Discuss a stupid idea. Make him feel big. Pat him on the back. Get out of here. <u class=line-red>Shut it</u>. Go to your service station.

Run to a rose garden. Pluck a flower. Fall home. Present your wife. Smile and <u class=line-red>shut it</u>.\np: Shut all the great things. All the bold things. All the marvellous and super awesome shitty things.  And turn off your brain. Sleep good.\np: Next day is a good day. A lively day. A bright day. A new day. No yesterday’s thoughts. No future plans.

Make at-least one product bad enough that creates a rejection, a dejection and a resistance. One product that makes people question your sanity. One thing, do everyday, they label you abnormal. Do one thing, deadly enough, that makes you question your sanity.\np: Please, do not give me the crap. Not the logics. Not the reasoning. Not the sobriety. Do not give me excuses. You are a coward. Accept it. You are not brave enough accept it. You are not yet prepared, or you are bounded by a rule, or your mother doesn’t approve? Shut it. It is not the reason. You are coward. Accept it.\np: If you can’t go out in open all naked, grow morality to accept the defeat. We humans are incomplete and not brave enough. We are not strong enough. Just accept it. More you fight, more you put fake excuses over your failures, <b>more you delay the successes and wealths</b>. More you act proud, and hide your fears, more you reject a happy life. More you act coward and label “Principles” / “rules” a reason to your failure, more you resist success.\np: Do not act stupid. Do not fight a reality. We all humans are coward. There is nothing to bolster, brag or prove. Act humble, down and low. Act human. Pitch yourself as you are. Not decorated, not crowned, not body-guarded. Real you. Come out in open, the real you, nothing but a skin, and take on this fight head on.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: baliopen.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Bali, Indonesia by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@belart84 target=_blank>Artem Beliaikin</a>\np: Your fights, failures, vulnerabilities and openly declared fears, will make you humble. You will need people around to fight other people. As you stand victorious, you will win some more people. Yesterday’s enemies will become your friends, brothers and your tribe. More people will join you. More they will share your burden. More they will push you. And more they will live your purpose.\np: Do not give up on people. They are your assets. Inside the ring, punch them, and break their jaw. Outside it, hug them like a brother. Outside the ring, the negations and the arguments, stand united. Act one. Stay lower. Outside, your conflicts, look like the best brothers in the world.\np: Soon your conflicts will be resolved. Soon it will all become fine. Soon you will see one good day of no more conflicts, losses and failures. Soon, the next curve on your road, this way, you will find a beautiful brother, a good wife and a bigger home. ",

Let’s fight our fears together.\nimg: ch6meetup.png\np.text-center.caption: Our today’s schedule, <a href=https://www.meetup.com/techshek/events/270989261/ target=_blank>RSVP here</a> to attend.\np: We gather, talk, hug, discuss and share our thoughts. We do not do these things much often. Each day the technology, twitter, fake social media networking is breaking us inside. We are instead of coming closer, going farther away from reality and meaningful relationships. We are tearing up inside. We are not sharing our true thoughts. We are becoming somebody’s else’s lyrics and somebody’s else’s music. It is leading us to isolation.\np: Let me tell you how we are going to fix it, through our monthly tech conferences.\nh3: 1. We are showing up fully transparent\nimg: ch2meetup.jpg\np.text-center.caption: This is us on Feb 9, 2020 · Our 2nd Chapter of this year.\np: You have few ideas that you want to validate. You fear judgement. You fear it is one bad idea and you do not want to say it out loud. You know what? We are going to discuss the worst ideas ever on planet earth. We are going to speak about them the loudest that they start feeling real.\np: This will guarantee you, your idea is still better. Your product has more potential. You have better ways of marketing and you have more chances of succeeding.\np: Our failures shown live on stage, will only give you courage. Our walking transparent, keeping the bar of high standards down and acting real, will only push you forward.\nh3: 2. We will be giving respect, not earning respect.\nimg.width-half: ch3meetup.jpeg\np.text-center.caption: This is us on Mar 1, 2020 · Our 3rd Chapter of this year.\np: This place is not to earn respect, become successful or get rich. Here, during our conferences / meetups we are not walking down the same old / patchy / broken road of immaterial successes and exponential graphs. Here, in our talks, we are going to give respect, give out our money, time and ears all out to our participants. We are going to show it. Not earn it. Neither do we plan on grabbing it anywhere in the near future.\nh3: 3. Is this the right place for you?\np.b-left: If you think, you are rejected, neglected and dejected. This is the perfect place for you.\np.b-left: If you have seen failures and you have a pain inside. This is the right place for you.\np.b-left: If you have thirst, which is never quenched, a belly never filled to the top, a heart never satisfied, this is a place for you.\np.b-left: If you want to help and see others coming above, instead of yourself, this is the right place for you.\nh3: 4. We are relying on Allah\nimg: quran02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Quran by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@ablossomingsoul target=_blank>Lexi T</a>\np: I have a broken Apple TV. This is used to connect our laptop to our event hall’s projector screen. Today it is faulty. It is not working. And I don’t know how I will manage it. There is an inside trust on Allah (GOD) that it will be fixed. It will come back alive as we reach our venue.\np: There are numerous other things broken.\np.b-left: 1. The person who is going to record our sessions, is committed else where and might not make it.\np.b-left: 2. The place is not properly aligned. The tables, the snacks and the hall is not prepared at all for a good event.\np.b-left: 3. The electricity issue is not resolved. We need a back up generator to make sure nothing interrupts the event.\np.b-left: 4. We have spared very short intervals, 5 minutes actually, to pick up attendees from their homes.\np.b-left: 5. We have not yet tested our zoom IDs and we do not know if it works right or not.\np: We are going head on towards making sure, we fail. We are taking this fight fully transparent. And we are learning to believe on Allah. We are learning the methods of Prophet Muhammad PBUH. We are learning to have faith.\nh3: 5. It is a head On fight\nimg: road02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Road by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@foxxmd target=_blank>Matt Duncan</a>\np: Honestly, inside I know, I am willing to lose all of my life towards my purpose. My livelihood, my siblings, my colleagues and my salary. Inside, I am ready if it is all taken away and I am left alone. Inside I know, this life is meaningless and this has to become adventure to put a meaning into it.\np: I am going all in, head on, unprepared, straight into the established norms, laid out rules and declared ethics. I am going straight towards it. And it brings with it, a million possibilities, hundreds of unknown fears and very bright chances of achieving success.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: water02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Shore by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@rajivperera target=_blank>Rajiv Perera</a>\np: We do not provide a comfortable environment during our sessions. Our attendees are made to sit hours helpless but listening to the growing hunger, curiosities and passion. We feed not Coke, not a good bread, not decorated snacks. We feed only passion / fire / ideas and curiosities. We lift lives by walking naked on stage; vulnerable, failed and original.\np: Above it, it is learning to code. Underneath it is the message of Quran. If you want to see Quran making wonders on earth; come on, join us, see us fail, see us walk blind and witness us fighting our fears.\np.note.end: One article every day · Follow our journey on twitter at <a href=https://twitter.com/zakatlists target=_blank>@zakatlists</a>.",

Do not forget why you <b class=brown>started</b>.\nimg: darts.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Target by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@24ameer target=_blank>Ameer Basheer</a>\np: Make it bold, bigger and large. Paste it on the front wall. When you commit something in your life, write it down and paste it in front of your eyes. Everyday you can see it. Everyday you realise the real reason you started working on the commitment.\np: For example, I was teaching my development class NodeJs (a programming language). It is a bottom language, lower side and not visible in front. And 3 days down, my entire class had forgotten why we started learning to Code. Our energy level went down. We felt lost and I realised it was not the problem of motivation. The problem was lack of focus on our aim. So we revived it back. We redrew the aim of fixing the web design, visible to people on a browser, as we saw where we were heading; we came back alive.\np: Let’s examine how we can increase our focus and make our journey colourful.\nquote: It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey. <br> - Unknown\np.b-left: 1.

The Secret Ingredient\nh3: <span class=circle>1</span> Write it down\nimg: writetop.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Write by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@campaign_creators target=_blank>Campaign Creators</a>\np: When you start working on your new thing, the crazy big idea that will make it all great, you need to believe in it. First off all, write it down on a paper with a bold black marker. “Why you are building it”. And hang it there, on your front wall. Take a photo. Make it your wall paper on phone and laptop.\np: Today, when the idea hits, it is beautiful, meaningful and exciting. Tomorrow, you will forget these feelings, if you do not record these feelings. The paper, wall paper, are these recordings that will give you a hit every day. You will feel great. Motivated. Powered. To keep working, keep pushing, keep breaking.\np: If you don’t record it now, you will fail tomorrow.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Relax\nimg: relax02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Relax by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@simonmigaj target=_blank>Simon Migaj</a>\np: We focus too much on un-important things in our life. The design, the aesthetics, the feel, the advertisement, the revenue and all things that are not needed to make you a success.\np: You do not need a website, not a blog, not a meet up, not an agency to make you success. These all things are difficult to learn skills and learning always takes time. These things will come as a by product of walking towards your journey and focusing on your destination.\np: Focus on purpose only. The destination. Inside your capacity, present skills, resources, limits, think on executing the plan and make it a reality.\nh3: <span class=circle>3</span> For example,\nimg: cart02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Cart by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@sandyching target=_blank>Sandy Ching</a>\np: If you want to open a restaurant in your major city. You do not need money, some chefs, sophisticated websites and media hype. Nothing of it is required if you want to stand out.\np: You buy a cart, buy rice from Savour Foods Islamabad, transport it to your cart, and start selling it standing anywhere clean. You do it everyday. Slowly you will find customers. Later you will find your own recipe. And some days down, you will find a shop. A shop will turn big and big and one day become a restaurant.\np: If you will lack focus on your destination, somewhere in between, at shop stage or at the cart stage, you will lose. You will miss out this hit and you will have to redo some patches again.\nh3: <span class=circle>4</span> The Secret Ingredient\nimg: bold02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Bold by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@trommelkopf target=_blank>Steve Harvey</a>\np: Inside it all, is only taking BOLD steps. Not hard work, not boring days sitting under a boss, not lengthy exams. It is none of that old rotten philosophy. If you want to achieve success in your life, you are needed to RELAX. And take very few bold decisions to take complete control of your life.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: pinned.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Pin on wall by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@peiwenhe target=_blank>PEIWEN HE</a>\np: It is a brotherly advice to you. From the core of my heart. If you want to live a great life. Full of fun and joy and happinesses. Pick up your bold black marker. Write your one exciting idea. Pin it to the wall. And go to sleep.\np: Honestly, do not work hard, extra, magical or productive. Just sleep. Relax. And have fun.\np: Your idea will keep you excited. It will push you to do amazing things. If it is hanged, always in front, on the wall, it will become a success itself.\np: You do not worry about its success. You do not focus on its tiny fractions and how it materialises. You stay away from it. You relax. Sleep. Have fun. Do not focus on the road. Focus on what is important. What is at the end of the road. ",

And you rightly know what is the line between good and failure.\np: Problem lies in, neglect, forsaking and resisting success coming your way. Your life, nature, material and circumstances want to lift your life up. They approach you humbly, opportunities, to take you out of catastrophe. But you do not think once, kicking it back in the belly. That you hurt your best moments and you reject them vehemently. It directly affects your own life quality.\np: E.g, I called a shop keeper yesterday. He straight away started abusing me. And he was not worried, if i am his customer and if he losses me, he will lose an opportunity. He did not feel bad. Neither ashamed. Nor guilty. It didn’t matter for him.\np: I say, act abusive, hit them in the belly, throw mud onto them and reject them. I say, act selfish. Do not grasp opportunities and do not listen to what can improve your life. I say, go solo.\np: But do not ever, feel bad, of your own poverty, failure or cripple. Do not label others a reason of your doomed life or a successful day. Do not put your shit on other people’s head, just because it gives you credibility, self fulfilment or a reason to sit under the pile of lowly.\np: Act brave. Embrace your failures. Shoulders tight. Head high. Eyes pointy. Face them. And if they attack you with rejection, kick them in their asses.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Precaution\nimg: pride02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Pride by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@sanderdechering target=_blank>Sander Dechering</a>\np: You know, pride. It is still bad. Be selfish, but do not feel brave enough, that you not need them. You need opportunities, you need people, you need friends, you need your family. Act selfish, means, you love them not to lift them up, but let them help you up.\np: They will sit beside you. They will read your blogs. They will attend your meetups. They will ask you about your momentum and they will want to chip in. If you do not give up on any of them, honestly, they will push you far better than your ugly mentor / counsellor sitting in New York or Sydney or Hampshire.\np: Love your people. Act precautions. Live worried about people. Not for them. For your own den. For your own future. And for your own success.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: harddisk02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Corrupt by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske target=_blank>Markus Spiske</a>\np: Become morally broken. Corrupt inside. Do bad things underneath. Act selfish and get your own things resolved. Be the baddest guy in the town of goons. Ok in the nicer town too. Be the ugly one. Rather ugliest.\np: First fix your own life. First get yourself rich. First find success, fulfilment, contentment and peace. And then, after you have it, break the bad guys down. Imprison them. Help police. Jump between buildings. Have a nice girlfriend and live one good life. For the rest of your life.\np.note.end: Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/zakatlists target=_blank>twitter</a> for one blog everyday.",

A fellow brother getting the hits, doesn’t mean you stop your own project and help him out. Your duty is just to encourage the fellow brother and continue working on your own thing.\np: You be worried about your own goal, commitment and brand. Your success is this community’s success. If Laurel Home School comes into being, it is sister Sajida’s success. If Justify Agency becomes a mega construction near the outskirts of Panoaqil, it is Aashir’s success. If the Tourist starts taking trips, foreigners and explorers to the north, find them quality restaurants and pitch them good tents, it is Hamid’s success.\np: Your success, is only, the needed agenda, priority and sound thing to do. Do not worry about somebody’s else’s problem.\np: You, only worry about yourself, your own brand and your own success.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Take your fight head on\nimg: coworkingusa02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Proof Technologies Inc, East 6th Street, Austin, Texas, USA by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@austindistel target=_blank>Austin Distel</a>\np: This community does not solve anything.

It does nothing of that sort.\np: You will still be same, after joining us, 1 month down this road, if you are finding yourself lost, deviated, de-tracked, you still will be lost. You won’t find the solution, inside this group. You won’t get anything useful here, unless you start taking your fights head On.\np: You have the potential already. The charisma already. The grace and passion already. You have it all, inside you, already. Nothing needs a fix. Nothing new needs to be learnt. No secret ingredient you will discover here, if you haven’t yet.\np: Believe in it. You are yourself enough famous, enough successful and enough passionate. You do not need more. Believe in it, you need less.\nh3: <span class=circle>3</span> Refine yourself\nimg: turkey02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Badavut Beach, Turkey by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@byadonia target=_blank>Şahin Yeşilyaprak</a>\np: Loose your chunks. Extra hours of instagram, Facebook, BBC and NETFLIX. Shed away un-necessary noises.\np: You do not need more time, more internet speed, more costly laptop, more skills and more money. You need less, far less than you have right now.\np: You are already busy, overcrowded and extremely hard pressed. Honestly, you do not need the hard work. You need to focus on less things. That you finally understand, you already have it; success, money and happiness.\np: Act original. Be pure. Live honest. Eye brows high. Heart pounded. Brave and Crazy. Sit like a king. Talk like a celebrity. Walk like a hero. And never act more than a big bold large ZERO.\np: Refine yourself. You do not need us. You do not need more. You only need <u class=line-red>less</u>, but its value understood, accepted and un-contended.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: zero.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Zero by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@bernardhermant target=_blank>Bernard Hermant</a>\np: Techshek is nothing more than a group of people who are talking life in 2020. It is just that, a WhatsApp group.\np: It will not change your life. It will not give you success. It will not make you win. It will not hold your hand. It will not fight your battles. It will not do you any good.\np: Honestly, we are helpless here. And this is what the reality is. We are not soft talks, cosy mothers and sugar tongues. We are not going to help you. We are not going to fight for you.\np: You, my brother, my sister, will have to start taking on your fights yourself, head On, with passion and zeal. You take the hits, you bleed, you fail, you rise, you beat back and you win the crowd. You become the hero, the voice and the brand. You, only you, become an inspiration, that people look up to you. That you make broken feel empowered, weaker feel bold and bad feel great. That we take pride in you. We tell others, “<b>we know this guy. He has been a shit his entire life and he made it all up from ground zero</b>”.\np.note.end: Follow us on <a href=https://twitter.com/zakatlists target=_blank>twitter</a> to watch us grow Big.",

We go haywire and we consume mother earth, without feeling grateful.\np: This day, our city’s destruction has started, from your own soul first, then your home, then your car gets a hit, then you lose your job and the so called bosses so blindly you believed in, snatches away the last bite of your meal.

        "body": "h1: Signs that indicate you are going right\np.note: If you are working on your project, and doubting yourself / your actions / initiatives, read today’s blog.\nimg: cchuckanut.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Chuckanut Mountain, United States by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@patrickian4 target=_blank>Patrick Fore</a>\np: Above all, have faith, it is all well. Your siblings are happy with you. Your relatives are fine. Your friends are ok. Your community is ok with whatever you are doing. This is the general principle of working on your own project; <b>getting out of useless worries</b>.\np: Next comes the signs / indicators that tell you if you are walking correctly on the defined track or not.\np.b-left: 1. Initially no one agrees with you\np.b-left: 2. Your home, neighbours and colleagues join you\nh3: Part I - No one agrees with you\nimg: fflame02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Flame by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@pcbulai target=_blank>Paul Bulai</a>\np: If they are agreeing, I think your purpose is not spicy 🌶 enough. Make it a little spicy. If they are not agreeing, I love you. Because, it tells, you are writing a story and soon this story will evolve into a reality.\np: Let me tell you, from the core bottom of my heart, they, the wife, the mother and the uncles, they should oppose you. Vehemently, abhorrently, hatefully they should put bad labels to you. Your closed ones have to hate every inch, every second and every moment of your life, to ensure you gain good momentum and you bring the fire to lit longer inside you.\np: If they are not hating yet. Try finding the passion, madness and love towards your own thing. Search your thing, discover it, fall in love with it, wake extra hours during daytime, talk extra loud during gatherings and hammer your thing hard enough, that you grab the attention. After that let them ask you bad questions. Later let them put bad labels to you. And finally, go isolated, completely alone and all dependent on your own instincts.\np: Brother, Sister, you need to trust your instincts. It won’t happen, unless you have nothing left in this world, but “the instincts”. Loneliness will teach you to trust your own potential, courage and charisma. Walking fully rejected will make you brave. Standing alone in the pits and taking the hits will make your enormous. You will have fire, the upper part, the faded and the hottest part, and you will burn everything to the ground. You, yourself, alone, will be enough.\nh3: Part II - People join you\nimg: mmeetup02.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Shopify, Rue de la Gauchetière Ouest, Montreal, QC, Canada by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@charlesdeluvio target=_blank>Charles Deluvio</a>\np: Through my personal experience, I have learnt something amazing. Initially my people got me admitted into Psychiatry ward. They put Mood Disorder label on me. I stayed alone, in prison, injected, numbed and lifeless, for 4 weeks. And it went on for another 3 months. And it taught me something different, “no one can help you, none, if you do not believe in yourself.”\np: Slowly, gradually, patch by patch, bit by bit, brick and mud, you will build, grow and become brave. You will find courage. You will learn to fight. You will stand your ground, naked and deprived. You will become bigger.\np: You know what, people love brave people. They love bigger and passionate guys. They love persistent assholes. People can’t ignore them and they praise them.\np: Same wife, same sister, same mother, and same colleague will call you, appreciate your blogs, clap on your meetups and hug you. Some will shed tears. Some will show love. And some will walk beside you, a day or two.\np: People you care so much today, soon they will isolate you, will not accompany you, at the start. Walking working on your own thing, with fire inside, Day 1 to 30, they will put rumble upon you. They will put you behind bars, if that is what it takes. Day 31 onwards, you will have everything; people, love, praise, fame and money.\np: So, do not work on these people. Work on your own thing. Isolation is an indication, you are now a solution.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: rrich03.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Rich by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@24ameer target=_blank>Ameer Basheer</a>\np: If you are not finding resistance, isolation and bullies, honestly, you need to wake up. You need to work on your own self. You need to take the hits. You need to be brave enough that can walk in the crowd, pelting stones, hurling bullies, shedding blood and smiling.\np: Brother, no college degree, no university position, no PHD certificate and no prime minister will teach you anything. All of it is only bullshit and you do not need it.\np: You need your own thing. Your own product. Your own idea. Your own purpose. You need to take your own hits. You need to win it for your own self. You need to get rich and you need to marry the most beautiful girl in your town. Ok, Marry four girls and these four be the most beautiful in your next four cities.\np: Because, if you won’t love it, a life of freedom, somebody else will come and rob it.",

It is not hard and fast rule to stay stuck at one place without the inner satisfaction.\nimg: packing.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Packing bags by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@tuckergood target=_blank>Tucker Good</a>\np: Hira, Mona, Abida, Adil and my wife even, have left this group. I say it is just fine. I still talk to these people who have left the group and I am still in love with my wife.\nh3: Try to stay firm to following 2 things when you leave.\np.b-left: 1. Read Quran\np.b-left: 2. Stay social with friends, specially me.\nh3: <span class=circle>1</span> Read Quran\nimg: lessneed.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Typewriter by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@tuckergood target=_blank>Tucker Good</a>\np: I have never been so successful in my life. That I have nothing. And I feel I have everything. Like seriously, pick Trump, I am more free, relieved and consistent than him. He might have better girls, authority and future, but me, I have nothing to worry.\np: Quran teaches you to live solo. It is a book that speaks loud. It is gigantic in wisdom and principles. Like, no one talks honestly, continuously and does not give up. But Quran does it. You open a page, it is same boring truth, consistently punching. It never gives up.\np: If you want to find success, hold tightest to Quran. Not your mother, not your boss, not your friend, not your idea, and not your booming franchise. Hold tight only to Quran.\np: You will find, you had enough already, and you were not looking at all the things you already had in your pocket.\np: Your fan moves, swings air, some particles vibrate, gravity pulls, hits the floor. Touches your feet. The neurons read them. Creates alien-atic sparks. Sends electrical signals to brain. Your brain registers it. And tells you, well, the air is flowing right and things are might be not that bad as they seem.\np: Imagine, electricity going out right now. Or gravity finding a bug. Or you have a missed a neuron signal. Or your brain does not register the next train of signals.\np: Your life will become a chaos. You won’t find a good doctor to fix your broken nervous system. You won’t find a psychiatrist to fix your brain. And you won’t find a scientist to fix gravity for you.\np: You will be left with nothing but Quran. I advise strongly, that you read Quran everyday in the morning. It will make you one rich guy, Quick.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Stay Social\nimg: onlinesocial.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Social by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@kingswagger target=_blank>Tucker Good</a>\np: Send copy pasted messages. Stupid recordings. Ugly dance clips. Fights. Camera recordings. Viral videos. BBC hammering scammers. Or what not.\np: But do send out something everyday to your friends. Stay in the loop. Make yourself accessible. Let them talk to you.\np: All good companies work with employees. All successful brands have good followers. Great scientists have people sitting down clapping 👏 to their key notes. Google has good amount of people who walk, talk, smile and lit bright their place.\np: Underneath, the equation will not change; people will always remain your biggest asset. You will need to take them seriously. You will need to give them their due respect. And you will need to honor them. Because not becoming socially active, will kill you, deprive you and you might end up doing something terrible.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: digitalnomad.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Digital Nomad by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@sinout target=_blank>Taras Zaluzhnyi</a>\np: I know I talk a lot. There are 8 billion people on earth. I haven’t talked to all of them yet. May be you feel me talking wrong, but the talk, hitting one heart, down in Santiago, will serve me well.\np: Talk. Like me. Become the most weird person. Most hate ridden. Most awkward. Most serious. Or Ugliest. Do not be afraid to be the lowest part of your community.\np: Here, you will find people, who do not carry disgust in their hearts. People who are ok with one meal a day. Here there are friends who are ok with dirty hands, used meals and stripped child’s clothing. Here, where the disgust lives, you will find, the best colors, most beautiful souls and true passion.\np: Leave me. No problem. Leave techshek no problem. Leave it all. But do not stop living. Do not stop exploring. Do not stop smiling. Do not stop loving. And most important, Do not stop Growing even for one day in your life.",

Ok, wife, love of my life, here it is. ❤️\nimg: solareclipse.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Solar eclipse by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@idavidgeo target=_blank>David Georgiyev</a>\np: Solar eclipse is when Sun 🌞 is blocked by the moon. That its rays do not reach the earth. That we can not see the sun. That moon is hovering at the place it should not be, logically.\np: If it is one in your area, please buy glasses, go out, experience living inside a dark day. It does not happen very often. Twice in a decade. It is unique. It is a wonderful feeling and it will cheer you up. Will definitely give you chills.\nh3: How you can seek light from today’s dark?\np.b-left: 1.

A ring in the air. Sun vanished. Life halted. No honking, crawling and cawing. Quiet and peaceful. 1 / 1000 days.\np: People, it is a Sunday. A day without work. No worries. No noise. No pollution. No requirements. No work. Today is a Free day. 1 / 7 days.\np: People, superimpose it. It will give you benefit of 7 x 1000 days in one day. Superimpose your interests. Superimpose your hobbies. Superimpose your projects. Superimpose everything around you. That you find more time to relax and less time to create.\np: Sit in a corner. Observe Sunday. And Observe Dark Moon. And a ring. Observe all of it. Do not write. Do not pick your pen. Do not prostrate. Do not pray. Do not move. Observe two things. Time ticking and ring fading. Find a wonder inside the life you are given. Your planet is moving at a shocking speed. And your life span is fading at a lightening speed. Observe the world and the moon and the clock and the people. Only observe.\np: You will find, you are sitting at a flying throne, controlling the air, walking the oceans and ruling the world. You will find you, yourself, have been in charge of your life’s wheels, your entire life. Before you did not took the control. Today, You can steer it your way. You can take a mega U Turn today. And You can become successful today.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Make One Announcement\nimg: speaker12.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Announce by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@snowshade target=_blank>Oleg Laptev</a>\np: Enough logics, fears, barriers, hurdles and sanity. Stop observing now. Start living now. Seriously, take control of your life, right now.\np: Make one announcement today. Do not give up on this commitment until you hit 365 days. You will miss some days in between. You will miss on your important deadlines. You will find yourself losing sanity. You will face criticism, doubts, labels and stones. But do not give up. Do not throw up.\np: Some days missed are ok. Some bad content is ok. Some boring and rejections are ok. You will find encouragement, love and abundance. You will find happiness. You will find peace. You will find contentment.\np: The key is, you do not give up on your announcement.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: mad12.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Mad by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@hermez777 target=_blank>Hermes Rivera</a>\np: Today a colleague told me, I am suffering with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. That I talk excessively about meetups. I am only focused about this one thing. I am not thinking out of it and what not.\np: Honestly, it broke a part of me. Well, I told myself, I am already broken, jointed and shattered. Few more dents won’t make me beautiful. I have already turned ugly.\np: You, my brother, need to take these labels. They should tell you, you are mood disorder, you are obsessive and you are over ambitious. They should call you abnormal. In fact, they should believe in your being abnormal.\np: Because, living is not when you have cosy and motherly comments your way. It is when you are getting the sickest labels your way. This is what they called Prophet PBUH. This is how they labelled Ray Kroc of McDonalds. And this is how they accused Iqbal. If you are getting these labels, have faith, you are on the right path, to crush something big, on your way.\np.note.end: To be honest. I need motivation. You can motivate me by following <a href=https://twitter.com/zakatlists target=_blank>@zakatlists</a> on twitter. Or by giving value to my upcoming <a href=https://twitter.com/techshekHQ target=_blank>meetup</a>.",

You were thinking overly about them. You were finding ways to fix it for them. You need to take a break here.\np: End your day at your own thoughts. The way you can fix your broken car.

I can not control the reward. Results are out of my hand. And I was worried about things that are out of my reach. Out of my scope. Out of my ways.\np: Please. Stop worrying. Stop thinking about your kids. Stop thinking about others. Stop worrying about others. You have to live one life. Live it like you mean it. Like it is the last day of your life.

Have courage, to (2) stay original.\nimg: donkey175.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Fayoum, Qesm Al Fayoum, Faiyum, Egypt by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@sedky target=_blank>Mhmd Sedky</a>\np: I have no followers. No million bucks in account. No fans. No money in pocket. No thing to prove you I am rich. I only have one thing to show, the streak count of my blogs. Well, I am consistent.\np: I am bragging. Yes you are right. Does it feel bad? You bet. It looks weird and it tells infinite things, imperfect in me, needs fixes. But the two principles have made it easier for me, living with imperfections.\nh3: Let’s get rich together\np.b-left: 1. You are Perfect\np.b-left: 2. Stay as you are, Original\nh3: <span class=circle>1</span> You are Perfect\nimg: surface175.jpg\np.text-center.caption: <a href=https://unsplash.com/@surface target=_blank>Surface</a>\np: All bad things start when you start underestimating your own self. For example:-\np.b-left: 1. Your own hard work not producing good enough results? Makes you think your hard work is not good enough.\np.b-left: 2. You talks are not having an impact? Makes you feel you are not talking good enough.\np.b-left: 3. Your relations are not good? Inside you, wrongly tells you, you are not social enough.\np: To be very honest, we all are like this. Broken talks, bad results and boring relationships. You are not alone.\np: Problem begins, when you tell yourself, the cause is “You”. When you start owning the responsibility of results. When you start acting socially responsible for your dad, your kids or your future.\np: You are perfect. Believe it. You are ok with the present situation of yourself. The guilt that is eating inside you, is bad. It is a stupid thought and you need to kill it right now. Your thoughts of being able to control your life, are killing you inside. Let them go. Live. Liberate. Free yourself of this guilt. You are perfect, the way you are, right now ___ imperfect, boring and bad.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Stay as you are, Original\nimg: factory175.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Affoltern, Zürich, Switzerland by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@condorito1953 target=_blank>Arie Wubben</a>\np: Stay awkward, boring and not so fun. As you are right now, stay like that today. When you talk to your friend, tell him the original you, is not so pretty. When you talk to your wife, show her, you are not so big. When you talk to your mother, show her you are not so humble. Stay original.\np: It will make living easier for you. You will not have to put a mask on your face. Neither carry a bag of masks. Nor overburden yourself with one wrongly spoken sentence at a gathering. Because, this is who you are, you will not worry an inch, of the results.\np: You will start feeling lighter. Boring words will start becoming attractive. Girls will look up-to you. Friends will honor you. Your mother will love you. Wife, even, will fight for you.\np: Everyone loves Original. But it is not easier. It is not soft. It is not cosy. Going all in, fully original, is hard. Had it been easier, everyone would have been original.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: car175.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Hasle LU, Schweiz by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@condorito1953 target=_blank>Arie Wubben</a>\np: I, myself, felt, life is for others. Living is for my uncles and my parents. My money is for my wife. My time is for my boss. My work is for my future.\np: I never thought about myself before. Ignored myself. Neglected. Always put a priority up front to finish first. Always put my results in front to judge myself. Always put an excuse up front to stop myself.\np: I have told all of them, the mother, the wife, the friend, the boss, now it is no more somebody’s else’s life. Now it is not others first. Now it is me, myself, first.\np: It made it all easier. Living. Breathing. Failing. Falling. And not getting the judging.\np: If you want to live a life of Freedom. You do not need money. Or fans. Or a car. Or a bigger house. You need to start loving yourself, first. And start working naked / original / awkward, next.\np.note.end: Please RSVP on our next month’s event on “productivity”. <a href=http://7.techshek.io target=_blank>Click here to RSVP</a>.",

We need girls to make sure we have dynamic values.\nimg: ttalk176.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Shopify, Rue de la Gauchetière Ouest, Montreal, QC, Canada by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@charlesdeluvio target=_blank>Charles Deluvio</a>\np: Sadaf, Sana, Sajida, Hira and few of my sisters are working on their side hustles. I keep telling them, there is more, keep running forward, keep working hard, soon we will be ok and we will be building bigger brands together.\np: A girl is dynamic. She is acknowledged fine on stage, and stage is what we are selling out to people. If we can bring our sisters to take the crowd with their limbs and tongues, believe me, there is nothing stopping us.\nh3: Let us add value to us\np.b-left: 1. Count them in\np.b-left: 2. Encourage them\nh3: 1. Count them in, as, Warriors\nimg: rroar176.jpg\np.text-center.caption: @ Discovery Park of America by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@andredantan19 target=_blank>Andre Tan</a>\np: A warrior is somebody not afraid of noise, thuds and kicks. Somebody who wants the rotten coin and is willing to lose his life over it. Warriors stand for small things. And when they stand, they are worth a sight.\np: We need to provide our girls a stage. Not because they deserve it by birth. Not because they are female and we like females around us. Not because we look at them and lust oozes out in us.\np: Because, they are warriors. And we are weak. They are stronger and we are small. They have seen the worst of their homes. They have seen the lowest of our society. They have seen peeking noses, hooting mobs and ugly rules all their lives.\np: We need to convince them, our stage is in need of help. It needs some yellow colors at the base. Some red on the back. Some spot lights on roof. Some carpet at front. A rostrum. A table. A chair. A place to sit and talk and inspire.\np: We need them. We need these people (girls). I do not know what convinces them and I do not know how they work. I only know, a girl on stage, head high, spine up, eye brows tilted, hands moving up and down, feet thudding and aggressive speaking; is all things, that will give fire to our message.\nh3: 2. Encourage them\nimg: ggirl176.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Girl by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@sherihoo target=_blank>Sheri Hooley</a>\np: Even when it feels, you do not like them. Even when you know, they are below you. Even when you have seen them taking you for granted, all your life. Still, encourage them. Lift them. Motivate them. Inspire them. And take them, like your younger brother.\np: They are girls. They will take you for granted. They will give you edgy words and pointy ignores. They are this way. You can’t fix it. You can’t correct it. You can’t do anything about it. You can only forego their rejection, abuse and attitude and still walk with humility beside them.\np: Encouragement is not soft hands, sober words and easy suggestions. It is “<u class=red-line>a pat on the back</u>”. You do not touch the base patting on somebody’s back. You do not lower yourself even 1 bit. You do not look weird patting anyone around you.\np: Pat, is a heroic act. You give it in a 1000th of a second. And it impacts, 1000 x of a 1000 seconds. It is a powerful act. It is when you are roaring, rushing and dodging the criticism your way, and you give a pat to your sister. She feels it deep inside her heart. She believes in your pat. She knows, it has impacted her. And she sees a warrior better than her.\np: Encourage them. Pat them on their back. Count them in as your family. You want them to speak for you at your next mega momentous launch. You want them to hold your brands, paint them colorful, take their prints, spread them to their fellows. Their words will bring in value, credibility and reputation. Their words will give your character a justified footing.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: sstop176.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Stop by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@kris_ricepees target=_blank>Gary Bendig</a>\np: Do not talk to us. Do not give us value. Do not walk for us. Do not decorate the stage. Do not design the poster. Do nothing of that sort.\np: I do not want my girls do any of the work, for me. I do not want you to motivate me, push me, acknowledge me or cushion me. I do not even want you beside me. You are free, to walk, run and dance.\np: I want to give you a place, a cosier and nicely decorated space, where there is no one intruding / hindering or stopping you. Some place where you evolve like you are meant to evolve. Where you walk, like you are meant to walk. Where you talk, like you want to talk.\np: I only believe so much in you, my sister, I know, your <b>humility</b> standing here, will win it all for us.\np.note.end: If you are a girl, and you want to help us build <a href=http://techshek.io target=_blank>techshek</a>, contact me for a meeting. <a href=mailto:qasimali24@gmail.com>Send a mail to qasimali24@gmail.com</a>.",

But the steps underneath are tiny and not so hard.\nimg: 1plant177.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Plant by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@marysill target=_blank>Mary Sill</a>\np: We wake up every day. Same breakfast. Same office. Same family. Same bed and same cycle everyday. We are fed up inside. Yet we do not change. Or we do not show an intent to change. Or we do not humble down a little and accept inside us, we really want it changed.\np: Changing small turns these ugly cycles of life into colorful wheels of our journey. We won’t have moved much, but our small steps will take us to the farthest lands and beautiful roads. We will see the world patching up, healing up brick by brick, fixing slowly and forward.\nh3: <span class=circle>1</span> Let’s change\nimg: 1smile177.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Wynwood, Miami, United States by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@artp_ target=_blank>A.R.T.Paola</a>\np: Keep all of it as it is. Do not buy a planner or sleep early. Do not wake up early. Do not commit publicly. Do not write a blog. Do none of same old boring things today. Do 1 thing today.\np: <u class=line-red>Smile</u> when you leave home. In your car. In your office. In your chair. On your rostrum. In front of your boss. In your home and in your bed.\np: Let them think, you are awkward today. Don’t worry they will get a hint some days down. Let them think, you are not busy enough today. Don’t worry they will see your hard work in few days. Let them think, you are aggressive and immature. They will know you in some days.\np: After you change one bit, and put on your smile, to hide a wrecked universe, they will consider it fixed, offensive or different. But, you will heal the brokenness inside you one bit today.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Let’s act selfish\nimg: 1shirt177.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Shirt by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@mushyy target=_blank>Mrushad Khombhadia</a>\np: I say, act totally selfish and think about only yourself. Do not try to make anyone else happy today. Not your wife, not your brother, not your friend and not your boss. I say, throw them all out of your life. Do not think one bit about them today.\np: More you burden yourself with their worries, more you hurt your life, more you find yourself lagging behind, more you lose them and eventually you hurt them, your relations.\np: I say, find your own goal today. Find your own future today. Draw it in your brain today. Think, building patch by patch, inch by inch, the walls, the floor, the halls and the roofs. Inside, find it all getting higher each passing moment. Each passing second, see it going up, and feel relieved. Feel better. Feel fine. And Smile.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: 1lonely177.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Spadina Avenue, Toronto, Canada by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@wflwong target=_blank>Warren Wong</a>\np: Do you love what you do? Honestly, I don’t. I don’t love any of the boring presentations and boring morning rituals and boring night updates. This all makes me go crazy. And I know, it hurts you too. I know what goes inside your heart when a small phone call places a burden over your head. I know, it hurts and it breaks a part of you.\np: You, need to be selfish, in everything you do. There is no other solution. No better way of living. And no other form of freedom. You be selfish today, you liberate yourself today, you break this barrier, you do not move one inch but a <b>bit</b> that you change your life today.\np: Your selfishness will make you happy. Inside you, you will know “it is fixed”. You will feel just fine. You will smile and you will run forward like a careless, worry-less child.\np.note.end: If you like these blogs <a href=https://twitter.com/zakatlists>follow us on twitter</a>. ",

You will keep working hard for people over pity pay scales and they will disown you just like that. When the day comes, they will drink your blood. Your bosses and your employers.\nh3: Two things required out of a Leader\np.b-left: 1. Leader owns his People\np.b-left: 2. Leader never takes the Credit\nh3: <span class=circle>1</span> Own your People\nimg: leader178.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Leader by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@kobuagency target=_blank>KOBU Agency</a>\np: Bro, I can not fix this country. Not this nation. Not the mindset. Not a brick or a stone. I am helpless. I can not help the martyred brothers neither their families nor their colleagues. I can give you a concrete advise that will bring you back to living.\np: You do not trust these organisations. You do not trust your bosses. You do not trust your elders. You do not trust your judiciary and broken laws. You do none of that; become a violent mob.\np: This is your country. From mud, to splash, to brick, to wind, to uniform, to profession and to parliament. All of it is yours. 100% yours. They, the elders, and the head of our institutions, are retarded, stupid, bogus and abnormal. They try to own your soul, but honestly, you have your own soul. You have your own profession. You have your own responsibility. And you do all the great works only for your own country.\np: Understand it. When you reach the head of the organisation position. Or when you hit your 50s. Understand it. Pin it to your chest. You gotta own your family’s problems. You got to take the hits if your kid brings bad name to your house. You got to take the accusations , accountability and blames, for a car accident, in your organisation. And You got to OWN, if a plane crashes down due to your kid’s negligence, in your country.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Leader never takes the Credit\nimg: give178.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Give by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@benwhitephotography target=_blank>Ben White</a>\np: Brother, I am not writing it to win popularity. I am not in need of money. I am in pain. Help me here.\np: You take the credit too often. You believe in your hard work so much, you do not want to lose the benefit. You do not want to give your piece of meal to a Hindu, or a Jew. You do not want to lose your house. You do not want to lose your car. You do not want to give up on the Credits your way.\np: Bro, you are a leader. A giant. A magnanimous structure. Huge soul and stature. You are bigger than all of this. You know these are glitters and these are meaningless. You know these temporary kicks doesn’t last a moment.\np: Do not take the credit for your hard work. Give the credit to somebody else who is in need. Give it to your boss. Give it to your employee. Give it to your brother. Give it to the pilot who downed your flight.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: 8303.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Crash site captured by <a href=https://www.samaa.tv/news/2020/05/survivor-recalls-horror-of-pk-8303-plane-crash/ target=_blank>SAMAA tv</a>\np: Pakistan has big bold empty souls in the highest chairs. It has goons and vagabonds controlling the chunks of our home. It, my and your country, is being controlled by people who are not leaders. They reached there through not leadership traits. They reached there after hard work, after taking the credits and after talking louder and walking emptier.\np: The plane in Karachi was fought bravely. It was flown greatly. It has the charisma. The calmness. The heroism and the bravery. One pilot of the kind who fought it till his last breath, is worth a million pilots who never underwent a fight. They, the pilots of PK8303, are our national heroes. They are our warriors. They are our fighters.\np: I feel, my blood brother, is not acknowledged for his life laid on the line of duty. And I do not find many people, feeling bad, ashamed or disgusted by the vehement declaration of hate against the children of this country.",

It helps.\nimg: joke179.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Joke by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@singerphotog target=_blank>Matt Sings</a>\np: Lengthy discussions almost never bears the fruit.

All of it.\nh3: Let’s get abnormal and weird\np.b-left: 1. Fight without reason\np.b-left: 2.

I have a close friend who visited me this morning. We talked about yesterday’s article. He said, I have spread hatred. I said, no I have spread love. It went on and on and no end was in sight. And I resorted to fighting over my opinion. Loud and abnormal. I acted difficult.\np: You need to fight sometimes. Sometimes you have to talk louder. Sometimes you should be breaking a mug or throwing a glass. Sometimes you need to act impulsive. Sometimes, once in a month, or 3 months, you have to break something really close to your heart.\np: Inside your heart, there are feelings. These erode over time. These need to shook, be jolted and surfaced. Sometimes, the old dead feelings of love, harmony and unity never surface, and you need to take magnanimous steps to bring them back. You do not manage to love, unless you find some blood, some broken jaws and some torn apart clothes. You do not really go deep into your heart, and see what resides there, unless you tear apart your self-made beliefs.\np: After the fight, we talked cool, showed love, wished greetings, smiled and parted our ways. I, and my friend, are more closer than ever.\nh3: <span class=circle>2</span> Love without sincerity\nimg: rose179.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Rose by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@jamie452 target=_blank>Jamie Street</a>\np: This is not a normal thing to do. Totally agree with you. It is stupid, weird and illogical. You really can’t love without sincerity inside your heart.\np: You need to stop caring. You need to stop loving others, your wife or your mother. You need to stop doing it for others. Everyday, your sincerity is taking a toll on your healthy routine life. You need to love, show it, without sincerity inside your heart.\np: You will feel weirdly content inside your heart. Your wife will be finding more ways to near you than before. Your mother will be sugar coating you and you will feel it. Your friends will hug you and you will see it.\np: There are unfilled patches in our relationships. We do not see them because we have never halted in our lives to take a step back and think. We do not see these hidden scars until we ponder and observe. We need to halt right now. We need to look at it carefully. And we have to find ways to mend it. We can not do it if we neglect ourselves and overburden ourselves with others' worries.\nh3: Conclusion\nimg: soar179.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Soar by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@elijahdhiett target=_blank>Elijah Hiett</a>\np: Forget what your elders have been telling you.

Give up on people for today. Go selfish. Go stupid. Go aggressive to the cosier spaces.

        "body": "h1: 2 x Rules of Muhammad\np.note: I am a muslim because I want to have the best shop in the market. Read the 2 x rules of Muhammad to build one.\np: I am a self centered guy. I want to kill it; success, money and girls. I want to have it all. A life of luxury, fun and joy.\np: I do not find any example better than Muhammad. I am a follower because I want to win it just like Muhammad. Best fan following. Most long lasting brand. Best customers. And jaw dropping fights.\nh3: Two rules that made our Prophet's brand a success\np: 1. He did not bank on people.\np: 2. He did not give up on people.\nh3: 1 — He did not bank on people\np: Muhammad had convinced himself there is a God. He had not seen it. Did not find him sitting in front of him in his childhood. There was no God and Muhammad finally managed to find One and put his entire trust on One.\np: It helped him walk alone his entire life. The initial 13 years of resistance, there were 42 people who walked beside him through thick and thin. And the remaining 10 years he had relatively more following.\np: Even after the die hard fans, love, popularity, social standing; Muhammad did not bank on his people. His child committing robbery, gets a hand cut. His daughter commits a crime, gets the due punishment. The entire tribe of Banu Qurayza is massacred.\np: No respect for wife, no fear of judgment, no fear of getting the hits. Muhammad, did not bank on his people to make his brand a success. He was a willing loser, who will not worry a dime, if he did not win his fight.\nh3: 2 — He did not give up on People\np: If a person urinates in the mosque, he is loved. If he burns Quran, he is hugged. If he hits and breaks the teeth of Prophet, he is told to teach the kids. He does not imprison people. He does not give them solitary confinements. He does not love for himself what he can’t find for his neighbour. He did not put burden on his employer, mother or tribe. He loved his enemies. He hugged them. He liberated them.\nMuhammad was all love and no hate. All principles and no boring, dull, stupid talks. He valued people’s time. He valued their principles. He valued ugly faces, smashed hearts and disjointed tribes.\np: I can write all night long about the love of Prophet to his people. And I can write all night long about the love of Muhammad to his principles. And I can not convince you; “You gotta be Muhammad to become a good brand”.\nYour brand will shine, elevate and impact, the best in the market.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Value Quran. It is the only book Muhammad kept closest to his heart. He fought over it. He defended it. He held it atop his head. He might have written it himself and he might have manipulated it. But the book, brought him to living, conquering and ruling.\np: I do not find one reason, being purely logical, to not listen to Muhammad. If I want to win, beautify my shop, near my customers and brand my product, I do not find ONE example better than Muhammad.\n",

        "body": "h1: How you can use iPhone’s Notes app to your advantage\np.note: All things start with ideas. And ideas are spontaneous spikes. If you do not connect these spikes thoroughly you do not put your ideas to work. Notes app is my go to app for listing ideas.\np: I am writing this article in notes app in my phone. Yesterday I invited Sana Nadeem, to join our WhatsApp community. The introduction, I wrote it in notes app. Some days back I created a video for makerlog, and script I wrote in notes app. I also write my tweets in notes app, before publishing them on twitter. If you take notes app out of my life, I will be dead.\nYou need your thoughts oriented, connected and sorted.\np.b-left: 1. Write everything down on a Digital Minimal place\np.b-left: 2. Do not make spelling mistakes\nh3: 1 — Write it down, “your super big idea”\np: All our ideas are big. You create google again. It will be different. You create Space X again, and it will be different. You redraw your own hand drawn line, it will be different. Different as in different proportions of ink, pen pressure, ink spread, paper undulations and different frame of mind. If you believe in yourself, your idea is good enough to become the next blockbuster.\np: Do not use plain old papers. Do not use diaries. And do not use internet to validate your idea. Do not touch anything else around. When you enter the idea spike zone. Sit. Relax. Think. Open notes app. And write bullet points:-\np.b-left: 1. What it will change ?\np.b-left: 2. What I will love building it ?\np.b-left: 3. What will fund my journey ?\np: Connect the dots on your notes app. It is big, empty, minimal and focus centric place. Switch on ‘do not disturb’ on your phone, laptop, door and landline phone. And dive into converting your spikes into words.\np: After you have gained some clarity, connect a little more. With clarity, you will be able to connect your thoughts while walking on the road, eating your dinner, watching tv or helping mother. Notes app gives you clarity to walk with your ideas right in front of you, in your everyday’s busy routine life.\nh3: 2 — Do not make spelling mistakes\np: After you have expressed yourself on the notes app. You will be sharing it for idea validation. You can be writing a tweet about it. Or you can be sending a text message to your brother asking for his time to discuss it. Or you can be writing a letter to a VC funding. Write it bold on your wall, behind the office desk.\np.quote: Do not make spelling mistakes.\np: It breaks the momentum of your talk. It gives unprofessional look to your brand. It tells your lack of sincerity. And it simply says, you are not willing to make it a reality.\np: Whatever you do in your life; talk, tweet, text, speak or try to avoid the jolted verbosities. Try to look professional. Your everyday things will start turning into simplistic ideas. You will be penn-ing them down more often. And slowly it will make you a content creator.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Notes app has grown me to a ‘content creator’. Unlike all the apps on my phone, I find this app, the only app, that has changed the most of my routine life.\np: If you do not have this app because you are not an iPhone user, I strongly suggest you stop using your phone. It is either leaking your memory, or making a privacy breach. Your accounts are vulnerable and your data is not yours.\np: Until buying the iPhone, use the notepad app on your windows laptop / computer to list your thing. Brainstorm your long awaited project. Simplify it down. Find out how it can start churning sooner. Start earning money, sitting home, thinking sane and acting simple.\np: Because, Making money online, in 2020, is the only way you will be doing justice to your time.",

        "body": "h1: A letter to members of techshek\np.note: I was feeling a little down today. So I talked to fellow members directly and I felt great. Let us become friends.\np: We are close to each other. Supporting, helping and available. We want to make sure we keep ourselves really down, humble and at the floor. We do not want to brag about our successes and we do not want to tell others how much money, kind of car or a model of laptop we carry on our back.\nWe want to make sure, we do not forget we are humans, flesh and bones underneath. Some money, a passport and a bigger brand does not elevate us over a fellow brother. We are so careful about talking to each other, that we do not want our talk makes any one feel lower than us.\np: Too much bragging, a lineage of successes and a series of hitting the golden buzzer, if not intended to lift the morale of fellow brothers, will dull down the colors of this group.\np: We belong to dust. We will stay a dust. Our ranks, skills, wisdom and achievements does not elevate us. We stay stuck to the ground in all circumstances.\np: I do not see this group like a typical whatsapp group. I see this group like a source of something big coming ahead of us. If we 45 people hold each others’ hands. If we encourage each other during weird encounters. If we clap even when we do not feel inspired. I am sure, we will become 45 outstanding brands.\np: A brand does not have to sit in Dubai Mall, or Manhattan square, or Silicon valley to prove it is a successful brand [we will do this too soon in our life]. It is a brand when you have a name given to you by your parents, you hold your sister’s bag and drop her to school, you stop your car to give water to a dog, or you sit at your home and they feel the warmth of love oozing out of you.\np: I love the flesh, the bones and the dust. It is the most precious ingredient in a human body. Things become bad, when we forget we are still dust, some flesh and few bones.\nPlease brothers, sisters of techshek, do not forget we are humans first. And we are all things after this.\nHuzaim and Sadaf are calling fellow members of our community to send an invite for our upcoming meetup of 5th July 2020. I assure you they are not better than you. They wanted me to ask them something fun to do, and this is how I asked them to help me out.\np: with Love and sincerity\np: From\np: — Qasim",

        "body": "h1: Why we should build teams instead of products\np: Teams create colorful spaces around us. They let us grow as a community. While products, without focusing on people, create a false sense of achievement.\np: Initially, rewind my life 6 months, I thought product matters. 3 months ago, I thought iterations matter. Today, I feel the user holding the product matters. In fact, the most important factor in creating a new product is the person who is going to use your product.\np: Focusing on people, raises communities, where people can sit, talk and feel comfortable. You can later, put your product in their hands and gather honest feedback to further polish it for the world. Once polished, launch it.\np: Let us specifically discuss how we can create the space where people can sit, team up and grow\np.b-left: Befriend a Stranger\np.b-left: Try to be the valuable part of his life\np.b-left: Make a product for your newly made friend that doesn’t disappoint him\nh3: 1 — Befriend a Stranger\np: Strangers are your best bet. No prior perception. No expectations. No hopes linked with you. You are one full human, pure, to a stranger even with all your flaws. In front of a stranger you can become whoever you want to become.\nThe stranger can be a person you find interesting on twitter. It can be somebody you find like you, in your neighbourhood or on the road. A stranger, can be your servant. It can be your boss. It can be any human, who doesn’t know you fully well.\np: Act selfish and cherry pick One person who clicks you. Try to befriend him. If you fail, no worries, you can select the next stranger. We are not short of strangers in this world. And after you find the right stranger, make him your friend. We will discuss later how to make him a good friend.\nh3: 2 — Build a product for your stranger friend\np: You do not need heads, claps, chores or drum beats to validate your product. You do not need even 10 people to let you know if you are going right or wrong. You need only 1 person, close to you, to let you know your instincts are right, wrong or stupid. The new friend you made, doesn’t know your flaws yet, he will be giving you the correct feedback.\np: Become valuable to him. He should feel comfortable talking to you. He should be clapping for you, to encourage you. He should be showing up at places, you need him, to lift you up. He should be your goto place in low times of your life. He, the new stranger friend, you made after reading this article, should be closest to your heart.\np: I know people say, family comes first. They also tell you, neighbours come first. Mother, your child or your servant comes first. To be honest, people tell you wrong things. It is not how you grow teams that create cosy spaces.\np: Your friends, who think like you, act like you, talk like you, come first. Because, your own resume, a good portfolio or a great product will help you more than your neighbour. So, build a team, that helps you create amazing spaces. The good neighbor, loving family or caring boss are a by product of your block buster successes.\nh3: 3 — Make something that does not disappoint your friends\np: You do not create a product, until you do not find a friend. Until you do not make a team. Until you do not gather your like minded people.\np: Stop, if you are creating something. Stop making it. Focus on finding the friend. Focus on helping him out one way or another. Focus on creating a positive space.\np: The product will be a by product of your will to bring people closer. It will be a good product. Like Apple, like whereby, like unsplash; your product will be to the point, easy to use and helpful. It will not be google, neither twitter nor facebook. It will be a good place to sit, talk and laugh.\nh3: Conclusion\np: If you ask me, did I create a team yet. Yep, I found Sadaf, I found Aashir, Ali Imran, Huzaim, Hashim and Jabran.\np: I found people, who are not egoistic, who do not care if they talk good or bad, who do not give foul talks and who do not humiliate a human being.\np: None of these are my wife, my mother, or my neighbour. These are the people, who have displayed the longest patience in all people I have met in my life.\np: I am not saying others are not close to me. They are people, upon whom I will not be giving up. I will try to bring ego out of them and make them clap on my presentation.\np: But until then, my product is going to help only these 6 people, who are the front face of our team.",

        "body": "h1: All the things that can go wrong using Facebook\np: I am not against social media. Not against people encouraging each other and discussing minds. Not at all against humans. Facebook exploits our weaknesses.\np: I have used facebook for over 10 years now. My entire neighbourhood, school, college and university lies here. You want to find a job, it sits there under some group, inside a member’s inbox. It is an entire universe with never ending possibilities. No doubt, it is big.\np: I don’t want to oppose it just because my ego got hurt somewhere. Or I was not heard loud enough. Or my product was not encouraged enough.\np: I am going to oppose it, because the moment I took the shift from consuming content to creating content, I got farther away from facebook.\nh3: 1 — Facebook is not designed to let you grow\np: You open a video feed and it shows another video with more attractive, informative and interesting video. And after that video another video more valuable. And the endless stream of suggestive videos never end.\np: We do not watch videos to learn. We shoot, edit and publish videos to learn. We create content and put it in somebody’s hands to learn. Unless it is a video put out there by me, it is not going to teach much to me. We have to get out of this mindset that teaches us; more information means more wisdom / skill / opportunity. More knowledge is noise.\np: If you want to create content / share it with your friends for feedback. Facebook is the wrong platform for you. Facebook will not ask you to spread it out. But it will ask you to “reach bigger audience for an X amount of dollars”. Investing your hard earned money here, will bring in meaningless likes and zero feedback.\np: Facebook does not help beginners become a better artist.\nh3: 2 — Facebook tells you, your experiences are not good enough\np: Experience is we all’s valuable asset. We have it driving to office, sitting with colleagues, talking to strangers in the grocery store or having a calm, polite walk with family before night.\np: Facebook, to be precise, tells you, your experiences were not good enough. Your family is just another family. Your car is just another car. Your friends are just like everybody’s friends.\nIt snatches away the confidence and belief you had in your own relationships, friends and products. You feel bad defending them. And you are considered arrogant, if in some way, you try to defend them.\np: In a town of 100 people, in 1880s, a person with loudest voice got the claps. Today, in a town of 100 million people, the same person does not find a right to seek encouragement. Facebook is this town, where only violent oppressors / preachers and looters take away your credit. And you, the small artist of 1880’s polite town, feel isolated.\np: You should grow your confidence by shutting your doors to outsiders.\nh3: 3 — Freedom lies in silence\np: Facebook is the worst platform to limit you. It does not mean that twitter, Insta, Snapchat or WhatsApp, are better. They are not as worst as facebook, but they are still ugly, if you are a consumer.\np: You got to stop listening to people. You got to stop taking in suggestions and advises. You got to stop letting the noise in. You got to pick your pencil, a white paper, find a quiet place and draw your goal. You got to pen down the steps that will lead you to your dream job. And you got to walk on your own curated path.\np: In silence you will find many answers. Like, how you can win the best girl, or the expensive car or a bigger home. Money, lies in silence. Life, lies in silence. Your victories lies in silence.\nIf you got carried away with the noise, it will take some time to win back the lost silence and re-drawing your path to success.\nh3: Conclusion\np: I often tell my friends, if they are not happy with the present me, my block buster successes and golden buzzers won’t change it one bit. They will still be wanting more out of me.\nYou can not convince people. They will always expect more from you. They will always have a crib against you. They will always find negatives inside you. You have to stop striving here. You will stand a loser here.\np: Shut down your phone, computer and TV. Stop opening your door to every knock. Isolate yourself from friends, family and neighbourhood. Go back to wilderness. Go back to acting selfish. Find what you were truly meant to conquer. Pen down your plan and start running towards your goal.\np: Else you are gonna die just like everybody else, without having fun, which is not fun.",

        "body": "h1: Advantages of being a 3rd world citizen\np.note: I feel, our people; Pakistan, India, Bengal do not participate in international gatherings. Guys, chill out. You got to dive in to taste the love of international community.\np: This is an original blog. Seriously, I am tired of people speaking soberly, wearing butterfly napkins and saving the noise of their heels. Get a life people. Grow up. Act original.\np: I feel comfortable talking to people who are humble. To be honest, book readers, more fans, difficult words, 24/7 artificial smile and sober dress is not humble. It is weird and illogical. \np: We asians, speak broken english, wear broken sandals, walk wearing stripped vests, have hairy chests and disgusting teeth. But this is what we are; original, humble and poor.\np: Let us discuss advantages of being original.\nh3: 1 — Act humble without getting weird looks\np: Excessive money, sobriety and discipline paves in new norms. Insane adventures start wearing off. Good words start winning attention. Education is considered a criteria to give value.\np: With discipline comes the perks. And people without discipline are not considered worth the time, attention or help. p: But in areas of no development, where traditions are not moulded due to ingress of better health services, broader roads and stronger economy, poor are still managing to find a respectful living. Their tarnished clothes are not impacting their lifestyle. And their humility is not causing them any guilt.\np: People in rural areas feel comfortable in their home towns. Their home grown school mates are still sitting beside them. Their bad habits are still considered entertaining. And their poverty is still considered their honour.\np: Do not migrate to a 1st world country if you are poor and you are happy with it.\nh3: 2 — Less money is fine for you\np: Most among us migrate, to earn more. First opportunity popping up to take us to America, is normally considered a gateway to heaven. We fall a prey to glittering gold. And we make the biggest mistake of our lives.\np: Friends, our bad policies, broken judiciary systems and ugly floors are better than somebody’s else’s home. You do not need money. You are used to poverty. You need respect. You are not used to humility. Stop, if you are thinking of migrating to somebody’s else’s home.\np: People of west specifically, are modern, well educated and sober. They have better norms and etiquettes. They will beat you sitting on the dining table. Or they will beat you on the road with no horns. Or they will smash you with their eternal cleanliness.\np: You, the Pakistani, Bengali or Indian, are happy in your home. You do not need to clean somebody’s else’s home to feed your children.\nh3: Conclusion\np: I have been interacting with people outside Pakistan. People with better education systems, hospitals and homes have a false sense of pride [I feel]. And, I feel, people of our countries have a false sense of guilt. Believe me, you are original, good and beautiful as you are.\np: The colour of the skin, curvy collar bones and grey hair does not elevate anyone in this world over you. You are good enough to sit, stand, write and speak, standing shoulder to shoulder with another brother from the West.\np: As you lose your originality, you lose our charisma, style and grace. Your life’s values start falling apart. Be you, the son of a farmer, eating with dirty hands and sleeping wearing your stripped vest. This way, you will find more respect, more freedom and more love, from the whole world.",

        "body": "h1: The most difficult task is to give value\np: I am doing catharsis. I have hurt more people in life than those whom I have given value. In fact, I do not know 1 person whose life was impacted because of me.\np: It is a difficult task. To sit in front of somebody, listen to his problems, dive into his thoughts, learn / unlearn and embrace new realities. To tone down our ego. It is tough to hear and feel somebody else.\np: Giving value does not mean giving an ear. It does not mean doing a job for him. It does not mean smiling, cheering and clapping for him. Value is not truly given until you save him.\np: Most of our brothers, sisters are drowning today. Some can’t fight addiction, some can’t fight humiliation and some can’t fight bombarded information. Some give up on life, some on studies and some on parents.\np: Honestly, it feels like collapsing and nobody is in sight who cares.\np: If we want to give value, we need to identify our enemies and we need to squash them, right now.\np.b-left: Problem. Porn / Lust / Filth & Addiction\np.b-left: Solution. Woods / Serene / Patience and Passion\nh3: 1 — Let’s discuss the problems I am facing living in my home\np: Porn, to be honest, is poking on my face everyday. It is inside Netflix, WhastApp, browser and social media timelines. I strongly feel attracted towards watching them. I strongly feel falling a prey to the loud bashing vandalism.\np: It gives rise to Lust, Filth and Addiction. It leads to social isolation. Impacts life quality. Turns you into an aimless object that eats, sleeps and breathes. Porn addiction makes you a slave to your boss, family and society. You do not feel comfortable taking decisions; what to eat, what to wear and what to drive. You feel lifeless. Inside your heart, you feel doomed, victimised and enchained.\np: This is most of Pakistan right now. Most of our college life and universities right now. Drugs are flowing in. Girls are finding difficult to fight. Children are dancing ‘high’ on dance floors. And elders are busy in their offices, working.\np: Something is collapsing every second around us, and we are not looking.\nh3: Why we need to focus on giving an impactful Value\np: Woods give you colors. White clouds, rising sun, birds chirp, breezing wind and splashing water, gives you patience, peace and life. Nature is humble, available and readily willing to heal you. Not the hospitals, not the confinements and not the rehab centers. Answer lies in woods.\np: We need to promote selfishness in our kids through a good loud display of passion. We need to bombard them with fire, that shakes inside out of them. We need to show them rattling chains, angry faces, war cries and willing warriors. We need to paint heroes on their bedroom’s wall. We need to put chalking on pillars under the bridges, walmarts and sideways. We need to make them hear the music of change, love and fire.\np: They are sleeping, and to wake them up, we will have to bring our drums closer to their ears.\nh3: Conclusion\np: I thought people were sensible, logical and saner. But more I look at them, more I feel they are weird. Everybody running to fix his own car.\np: Happiness lies in your bed’s mattress, with your heart burning with passion. In your sofa, with your mind dazzling with ideas. In your kitchen, with your hands directing the lightning sparks. When you walk in the shitty corner of your town with a smile on your face and a glow in your hand, you really find happiness.\np: Ok Guys ! Shut this porn, addiction, late night sleeping patterns and get back to living. This is no use, “dying without really living the fun”. You deserve it better than your dad, friends and neighbors. Better than your girlfriend. Better than your wife. Act selfish, ignite fire in your heart and take the jump.\np: Because, if you won’t, you will never taste the true living.",

None, in his life and after his life, has created doubts, rung bells or bolstered false flags. His life, missions and friends, were clear on what to achieve and how to achieve them. All of it laid down like a decorated butter, ready for him to slide his fingers inside and eat, placed in front of him.\np: Such goals were phrased before him as well. Few who pursued these goals stood victorious and are today recalled as heroes of Allah in Quran.\np: You got to make your like minded your friends. Quran is the best mind, exactly like you. It has narrated Haroon, Musa, Ibrahim, Nuh and Daud. None in your friends, is recalling these heroes. None are painting our walls with their slogans. And none are standing for the hard earned victories spread by these warriors. None, but Quran.\np: What else do you need to convince yourself to become one hero exactly like the heroes of Allah and Quran. To be honest, there is nothing that stops you.\nh3: 2 — Fight, fail and repeat until you win\np: I won’t tell you to stand on a roundabout and raise slogans of Allah. Or put a label on your chest of Terror and spread violence. Or break few chairs in your office and hurt your boss. Not, abnormal, wierd or a person filled with hatred. — You can do this also, there is nothing wrong with it.\np: Act humble. Stay low. On the floor. Put mud over your head. And make sure your people make fun of you. In fact, act so low, that the rejection and resistance breaks your ego.\np: Soon, your failures will pile up. The rejection will bring you to isolation. Soon, you will see people do not stand beside you, when you do not stand beside them. Soon, wisdom and knowledge will pave its way towards you. Soon, things will become clearer and you will find, the worst failures to polish and shape you.\np: You won time, peace, wisdom and patience. The beatings and thrashing brought you an ample amount of time. People stopped calling you for meetings, chit chats and late night discussions. Your boss fears you. Your family respects you. You, now rule your own kingdom to just sit, curate and sing.\np: With failures, continuous beatings and peltings, you find an enormous amount of time to work on improving your life. Slowly, it all add ups and makes you the same worth as heroes of Allah.\nh3: Conclusion\np: As I talk to people more, more they throw trash on me. It is a reality. As I give them respect, their ego grows higher and they throw it on me. People who I trust, feel, are my colleagues, eventually throw mud on me.\np: I find, none, in this world, is good enough friend as it is Allah. None, who doesn’t falter, shake or gives up on me, but Allah. None, truthful, adventurous, forthcoming and helpful, as good as Allah.\np: It opens new doors to me. I know, it is now a walk on the path of heroes of Allah. I know it will reward me just like Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Haroon and Muhammad. I know it will bring forth new kingdoms, people and tribes, who will not be labelled muslim. I know I will not find them in our today’s flags of Islam but some will be hindus, some jews and some prostitutes.\np: I know, the heroes lie not among us. They are here, but not under the muddy and ugly sheets of so-called Islam. They are here; soon they will gather and pave ways to unite together. Soon we will witness them spreading message of Allah in our streets.",

        "body": "h1: There is no Hurry\np.note: I saw this statement written by my boss in our old office. I was confused back then, why did he make it so bold. Now I think, I know, some of the reasons.\np: Someone dies because you do not respond your phone. Someone’s birth is delayed due to a traffic jam. The plane is going nose dive down, and I am told, there is no hurry.\np: Friends, I agree with it. Plane will hit the ground, if it is a broken wing, expired engines or damaged belly. There is nothing stopping it from hitting loud. And there is nothing stopping you from death. Things happen anyways, our hurriedness only spoils the fun.\np.bold: We will discuss today, why staying calm is more important than trying to control the crashing plane\np.b-left: Life is about comfort and ease\np.b-left: We do not have a control over any thing around us\nh3: 1 — Life is fun ONLY\np: You want to influence, get rich, find peace and raise a generation more successful than you. You want people respect you. You want a name in your town. You want you do not miss out the Fun?\np: It is all accessible to you, right now. Right now start acting weird to your mother, brother and father. Start talking to people using pre-scheduled meetings. Start speaking to more people as a writer or a speaker. Right now, embrace the attitude of a millionaire.\np: Initially they will all label you a weirdo. Later they will label you ignorant. Down this road, some days later, they will label you a good person. And very soon, they will give you their ear. You will influence them, teach them, befriend them, and rise with them.\np: Changing your attitude right now, will lift your status in everybody’s eyes, right now. The first label your way, tells you, you have begun your journey to influencing minds and winning hearts.\np: I guarantee you, you will not lose your job, wife or car. It will all still be there. You will not fail your exams. It will all still be here. You will not fall behind, one tiny step, in your career; it will all be presented to you in a nicely decorated souvenir.\nh3: 2 — Stop trying to CONTROL\np: We all defend our egos. Fight hard to win arguments. Plan great things to make sure we win. Our entire life revolves around, winning the next presentation, assignment or discussion. We are in a state of competition to somehow prove to the world, they were wrong and you were right.\np: I say, do all the effort and you will still fail to convince them, they are wrong. You are one speck on this world, that will never create one cm of an impact. Stop working hard, because things are not in your control.\np: You might ask, “Then we should not work at all ?”\np: The perfect answer you will get today, is, “YES, Stop Working Right Now”.\np: Anything that is not fun, is not worth it. Stop wasting your energy to meet other’s expectations. When you already know, there is not an inch of control over what happens to you in your future, your worrying about it, is not worth it.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Relax, chill, enjoy and live. Sleep. Watch movies and eat pop corns. Dance, sing and go high. Just start living.\np: I know, it is stupid to waste your time and not put in any work towards your future. I know I am saying wrong things.\np: But, I am done with giving the complete suggestions and lengthier plans. You got to figure it out yourself. I can only tell you, if it is not fun, it is not really worth it.",

        "body": "h1: Life in a Prison Cell\np.note: I made a new friend today, Amir. He spent a week in a prison cell. Recalled what it was like in there. We concluded; louder uprightness leads to trouble.\np: I have spent nearly 2 months in a confinement. It was a prison cell. Ok not a cell for criminals, but a cell for insane people. I have been labelled insane since then. And my fight after the prison, is not much different. It is a continuous struggle to convince the world; I am Ok, the warden was wrong.\np: Well, it doesn’t make much of a difference. Whether the world is convinced, convicted, brings a sorry face or attacks back. It won’t change one fact; life inside prison is hard.\nh3: What it was like sitting without freedom, chained inside a prison cell and getting labelled “insane”\np: The prison for criminals is hard. Not easy. Not sober. Not freedom. And not good. I agree. But the criminal gets a name for a crime. He gets a lawyer. He gets a family to fight for him. He gets the world to label him rightfully for what he has done. He is not labelled weird things. He doesn’t fight for winning a sane name. He has an advantage here.\np: A person in asylum house doesn’t get a lawyer, a family or a prison warden. The warden, or say a doctor, is not a friend. He is trained to convince your family, your son is not normal. And son, other than God, doesn’t have a fellow, who knows the family’s son is not insane.\np: I think, it is not just; a prisoner gets the benefits, sympathy and credibility. But another fellow in a similar cell doesn’t get any popularity.\np: You can feel it, the pain, I have. It is huge, gigantic and painful. Every moment of my life, I feel worst for the people imprisoned, enchained and snatched from their families by the war mongering machines. Every second my hate towards psychiatry grows. And every second I work harder to beat these walls down.\nh3: My life after the asylum house\np: It is fine. Honestly it is good, peaceful and fun. I am writing this article sitting in a world class restaurant. Zinger burger is about to be served. Some one is preparing a chicken boneless handi. Guests are coming to my house in an hour. Fan is placed opposite and its smooth hum is keeping it all cosy and easy. No mosquitoes or sweating. Life is easy.\np: I have a community of nearly 590 people now. Good following on twitter. Sober family friends. Good contacts. Some are senior in ranks, some are high in humility and some are good in wealth. Myself, not falling short of wealth as well.\np.note: Did I lose a tiny bit after getting weird names and 2 years of hate speech?\np: No. I am sailing smooth. New windows. New opportunities. New avenues. New routes. And new valleys. All new doors to all the new possibilities are here laid in front of me. I just got to pick one, paint a little, make a small movie clip, give a light tone presentation, or gather developers to make a simple product.\np: Contributing to the society has become easier. Guiding children to living a healthy life style has become a hobby. Talking to foreigners and giving them feedback on their well knitted products have become my evening talk. I now own a studio. I have a good team. Some send messages to people around before our events. Some call people. Some make flyers. And some market our messages.\nh3: I am coming for the goons\np: Someday soon, some people will ask me it is all illegal. It is all wrong. It is all insane. And it is all forbidden. Someday, someone will grow a spine to challenge me. And someday, we will beat these walls down.\np: I would say to my brother, Amir, I met today; Don’t worry, we are coming for these goons.\nh3: Conclusion\np: I am not against dishonesty. Neither against violence. I think all the tools in love, in war, in bed or in job, are ok. Defence is ok. When you get pricked, shovelled or tricked. You get the cards in your hands. You take the initiative in your hands. And there on, after you are humiliated, you get a psychological victory over your opponent. You decide the next few turns in your fight.\np: The cards are in our hands now. We are deciding the turns now. Some day we are writing good. Some day we are speaking good. We are not yet poking the wardens, logicals and ethicals. We are not yet taking the turns.\np: Relax. We are coming for the goons. Soon we will smash these windows. Demolish these walls. And soon, we will make it all peaceful. Just like, it used to be in the times of Prophet PBUH, we are going to make our prisoners our teachers, our mentors and our generals. Just like, Wehshi became our hunter, Khalid became our warrior and Ikrama became our general, we are going to put some humans inside our uniforms.\np.note: This article is a tribute to Amir, who was imprisoned by a Psychiatrist in a psychiatry ward after he got into a fight with the psychiatrist’s friend.",

        "body": "h1: Living inside Techshek\np.note: It is just a community, a band of brothers, who take Prophet Muhammad’s words quite seriously. Let’s get deeper into how this place can maximum benefit you.\np: Everything is above us. Your reputation, your success, your attention and your failure. Your failure is all of ours failure. Your fall is we all falling together.\np: Guys, be humble, stick to acting like Prophet Muhammad PBUH and his companions, where we are meant to spread Quran through Github, zoom, google meets, personal branding and meet-ups.\nh3: Here are some guidelines that needs to be pinned to your chest\np.b-left: 1. Do not worry\np.b-left: 2. Take your fight head On\np.b-left: 3. Refine yourself\nh3: 1 — Do not worry about fellow members’ success\np: You do not want to overburden yourself with somebody’s else’s problems. A fellow brother getting the hits, doesn’t mean you stop your own project and help him out. Your duty is just to encourage the fellow brother and continue working on your own thing.\np: You be worried about your own goal, commitment and brand. Your success is this community’s success. If Laurel Home School comes into being, it is sister Sajida’s success. If Justify Agency becomes a mega construction near the outskirts of Panoaqil, it is Aashir’s success. If the Tourist starts taking trips, foreigners and explorers to the north, find them quality restaurants and pitch them good tents, it is Hamid’s success.\np: Your success, is only, the needed agenda, priority and sound thing to do. Do not worry about somebody’s else’s problem.\np: You, only worry about yourself, your own brand and your own success.\nh3: 2 — Take your fight head on\np: This community does not solve anything. It does not fix your brand. It does not inspire you. It does nothing of that sort.\np: You will still be same, after joining us, 1 month down this road, if you are finding yourself lost, deviated, de-tracked, you still will be lost. You won’t find the solution, inside this group. You won’t get anything useful here, unless you start taking your fights head On.\np: You have the potential already. The charisma already. The grace and passion already. You have it all, inside you, already. Nothing needs a fix. Nothing new needs to be learnt. No secret ingredient you will discover here, if you haven’t yet.\np: Believe in it. You are yourself enough famous, enough successful and enough passionate. You do not need more. Believe in it, you need less.\nh3: 3 — Refine yourself\np: Loose your chunks. Extra hours of instagram, Facebook, BBC and NETFLIX. Shed away un-necessary noises.\np: You do not need more time, more internet speed, more costly laptop, more skills and more money. You need less, far less than you have right now.\np: You are already busy, overcrowded and extremely hard pressed. Honestly, you do not need the hard work. You need to focus on less things. That you finally understand, you already have it; success, money and happiness.\np: Act original. Be pure. Live honest. Eye brows high. Heart pounded. Brave and Crazy. Sit like a king. Talk like a celebrity. Walk like a hero. And never act more than a big bold large ZERO.\np: Refine yourself. You do not need us. You do not need more. You only need less, but its value understood, accepted and un-contended.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Techshek is nothing more than a group of people who are talking life in 2020. It is just that, a WhatsApp group.\np: It will not change your life. It will not give you success. It will not make you win. It will not hold your hand. It will not fight your battles. It will not do you any good.\np: Honestly, we are helpless here. And this is what the reality is. We are not soft talks, cosy mothers and sugar tongues. We are not going to help you. We are not going to fight for you.\np: You, my brother, my sister, will have to start taking on your fights yourself, head On, with passion and zeal. You take the hits, you bleed, you fail, you rise, you beat back and you win the crowd. You become the hero, the voice and the brand. You, only you, become an inspiration, that people look up to you. That you make broken feel empowered, weaker feel bold and bad feel great. That we take pride in you. We tell others, “ we know this guy. He has been a FAILUE his entire life and he made it all up from ground zero “.",

        "body": "h1: Role of Girls\np: I am happy I am writing about it. We need girls to make sure we have dynamic values.\np: Sadaf, Sana, Sajida, Hira and few of my sisters are working on their side hustles. I keep telling them, there is more, keep running forward, keep working hard, soon we will be ok and we will be building bigger brands together.\np: A girl is dynamic. She is acknowledged fine on stage, and stage is what we are selling out to people. If we can bring our sisters to take the crowd with their limbs and tongues, believe me, there is nothing stopping us.\np: Let us add value to us\np.b-left: 1. Count them in\np.b-left: 2. Encourage them\nh3: 1 — Count them in, as, Warriors\np: A warrior is somebody not afraid of noise, thuds and kicks. Somebody who wants the rotten coin and is willing to lose his life over it. Warriors stand for small things. And when they stand, they are worth a sight.\np: We need to provide our girls a stage. Not because they deserve it by birth. Not because they are female and we like females around us. Not because we look at them and lust oozes out in us.\np: Because, they are warriors. And we are weak. They are stronger and we are small. They have seen the worst of their homes. They have seen the lowest of our society. They have seen peeking noses, hooting mobs and ugly rules all their lives.\np: We need to convince them, our stage is in need of help. It needs some yellow colors at the base. Some red on the back. Some spot lights on roof. Some carpet at front. A rostrum. A table. A chair. A place to sit and talk and inspire.\np: We need them. We need these people (girls). I do not know what convinces them and I do not know how they work. I only know, a girl on stage, head high, spine up, eye brows tilted, hands moving up and down, feet thudding and aggressive speaking; is all things, that will give fire to our message.\nh3: 2 — Encourage them\np: Even when it feels, you do not like them. Even when you know, they are below you. Even when you have seen them taking you for granted, all your life. Still, encourage them. Lift them. Motivate them. Inspire them. And take them, like your younger brother.\np: They are girls. They will take you for granted. They will give you edgy words and pointy ignores. They are this way. You can’t fix it. You can’t correct it. You can’t do anything about it. You can only forego their rejection, abuse and attitude and still walk with humility beside them.\np: Encouragement is not soft hands, sober words and easy suggestions. It is “ a pat on the back “. You do not touch the base patting on somebody’s back. You do not lower yourself even 1 bit. You do not look weird patting anyone around you.\np: Pat, is a heroic act. You give it in a 1000th of a second. And it impacts, 1000 x of a 1000 seconds. It is a powerful act. It is when you are roaring, rushing and dodging the criticism your way, and you give a pat to your sister. She feels it deep inside her heart. She believes in your pat. She knows, it has impacted her. And she sees a warrior better than her.\np: Encourage them. Pat them on their back. Count them in as your family. You want them to speak for you at your next mega momentous launch. You want them to hold your brands, paint them colourful, take their prints, spread them to their fellows. Their words will bring in value, credibility and reputation. Their words will give your character a justified footing.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Do not talk to us. Do not give us value. Do not walk for us. Do not decorate the stage. Do not design the poster. Do nothing of that sort.\np: I do not want my girls do any of the work, for me. I do not want you to motivate me, push me, acknowledge me or cushion me. I do not even want you beside me. You are free, to walk, run and dance.\np: I want to give you a place, a cosier and nicely decorated space, where there is no one intruding / hindering or stopping you. Some place where you evolve like you are meant to evolve. Where you walk, like you are meant to walk. Where you talk, like you want to talk.\np: I only believe so much in you, my sister, I know, your humility standing here, will win it all for us.\np.note: If you are a girl, and you want to help us grow techshek stronger, DM me for a casual meeting.",

        "body": "h1: Follow your passion or Passionately do what you are already doing?\np.note: This article is inspired by Cal Newport’s talk at Google in 2012, where he did a deep analysis of Steve Jobs famous phrase “The only way to do great work is to do what you love”.\np: Cal Newport is right; You do not know yet where you are heading. You only have an opportunity in front of you, that you can pick and refine hard to prove your mettle. Do your job so good, that they cannot ignore you, but let you win.\np: I agree, passion is for seekers. And if you are not a seeker, you got to build passion. I think, Cal went too far to convince people to not believe in “follow your passion” advise. He even quoted the oldest instance of this phrase happening in a play of 1950s. It is true, passion can be a distorted goal, and it can prove fatal to your career.\nh3: But.. Should we stop Living, if we do not find an answer?\np: A seeker, I try to be one, got to win his freedom. That is what Steve Jobs did while building a computer in his garage. He did not build it in IBM labs, or a workshop, or a school laboratory. He built it inside his own home. The only place that gives you true freedom to do what you truly love.\np: If you are not a seeker, if you do not find passion around you, or if you are not satisfied with your life, the responsibility does not fall on your shoulders. You do not deserve to be criticized. You still are a human, who needs due attention and respect. The ‘human’ claim is something that no one can snatch from you.\np: If it seems confusing, I am trying to say you, if quitting your job looks right to you, do it. If smuggling seems feasible, do it. If stealing or snatching seems ok, go ahead, do it.\np: You are a free human being. And nobody in the world, has a right over your freedom. Some pennies and pounds can not snatch away what is yours. Some good talks can not let others smash you. Some sober meetings and respectful words can not buy you.\np: Freedom has been your right since your birth. It got to be yours, till you die.\nh3: Be a seeker\np: If you are not yet convinced to quit your job, or travel north, or go off grid for some months; I believe, you have not yet become a true seeker.\np: Let me confess, I too have not become a seeker.\np: A seeker, does not have a boundary, a barrier, a limit to crave his wantings. He doesn’t stop, excuse or shudder. He is quiet. He is happy. He is free.\np: Follow your passion, is solely, a way of life. It gives you wings to take a flight and move with a permanent mind set to one place. Stay here. Explore. Find the meanings. And erase the permanent mindset.\np: It has been preached by Prophet Muhammad PBUH. His companions lived a life of freedom. Some could fight a battle, some could knit clothes and some could act messengers. All were equal, to do what all wanted and still carry a rank, a responsibility or a title on their shoulder.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Cal Newport is not wrong here. Steve Jobs also was not wrong. All great people find their new ‘new’ and pursue it. Some become great artist, some technology enthusiasts and some religious figure.\np: All the people around us have somehow found the right way to live their lives. All have discovered what makes them happy. All know the truth, the right and the wrong. All have the core recipe to live a life of a great artist.\np: Difference lie when some fail to act, some fail to give up on ego, some fail to unlearn and some fail to show up. Life had it all, for all of us. Some decided to live their entire life in poverty and not win back their lost dignity. Some decide to take the hits, fall, fail and still not give up. These, the later kind, are called seekers, who never stop living.\n",

She made some loud noises standing in morally collapsed corridors to snub one of the weakest hearts.\np: I stand for her today, even if she tells me, I am a bad person, or I do not fulfil her rights, or I am not running fast enough.\nh3: Enough of the hatred\np: Let us love our wives.

I know, I am bad, poet or writer or broken, but I am not able to give her what she deserves any day soon.\np: Life is good. Honestly it is fine. But why this hatred, ugliness or anger. Why do I fail to find the heart inside and fail to love it. Why do I always stop and not look deeper into what she thinks. What she wants. What she deserves.\np: I am a buffoon who do not understand, what she wants.\nh3: How do I make it up to her\np: Some said, I am not good enough. Some said, leave me alone. Some said, enough of the sobriety. And some said enough of the freedom.\np: Do I make it up to her or not? Do I move and fix it all today or not? Do I take some more hours off my busy office routine or not? Do I live or not?\np: It is a never ending quest. It is taking a toll. It is taking some snatching the grace and lowering the charisma. It is taking time.\np: Can it all happen fast enough. Can we unite soon enough? Can I find the peace, serenity and quiet time enough? Can I find Prophet Muhammad any sooner? Can I convince her it is all for him? Can I tell them it is not boring or stupid or weird?\nListen wife\np: She said, I should have appeared. I should have at least tried. I should have at the minimum, shown up.\np: I do not find it meaningful anymore. Running the same sprint, same track and same goal any more. I am done with the repeated proving of my good-enough capabilities. I have shown them I can do all the things. Now I do not have the courage, stamina and zeal to run the entire cycle again.\np: It is freedom. In woods, in the morning, near the air and sober breeze, there is more. It is some noise there. Still I can hear it and feel it spoiling the fun. Let it go quiet. Let it all go serene, my gal, and I will show you what is really living.",

        "body": "h1: Insanity vs Sanity — in today’s world\np.note: It is hurting to see people thinking success is more likes and more claps. It is not, it is just a buzz, that gives momentary spike and fades.\np: Come on guys, you know life is full of opportunities, colors and directions. I don’t have to tell it to you. You know it; life is fun, happiness and love. I don’t have to hammer it on your head. Life is cool. You know it, your father knows it and your distant angry cousin knows it.\nh3: For a moment — agree to Disagreement\np: Do not judge anybody. Do not label bad names to your loved ones. Do not put burden on them. If they tell you what hurts them, simply, solve it; “stop doing it”.\np: When we fail to overcome our inner fear we lose conscious and ultimately we lose what we love or our loved ones. Fear makes us selfish, distracted and lost. Fear tells us, we are in need of control, when instead we are in control of fear. Do not let fear stop you — from living to your true potential.\np: You have the potential, you only need minor adjustments in your day to day life, to get back to smiling and laughing. You have all the ingredients to make your living Fun. Problem begins, when you let your fears, limit your potential.\nh3: If you agree — get on to “Acting”\np: Without “acting” you do not gain momentum. Without momentum you do not find the Will to face your fear. With out facing your fear, you do not tame it. Without colliding, failing, falling and hauntings — you do not learn to live.\np: Honestly, you never succeed in this world. We muslims think Prophet PBUH won, but, he also did not make it all come true. He did not spread light the way he wanted. He didn’t make it all happy, cosy and fun. He was convinced, finally; that success is only “living in the moment” — the present, now, the ride, rolling, moving, breezing past our face, is the real success.\np: Get on to acting, on your discovered principles. You will maximum fail, lose some money, get a label, but you will have tried sooner. Sooner you will have faced the consequences and understood the right path. Sooner you will have lived how you really want to live.\nh3: Believe in yourself — believe me\np: Your closed ones are the first to tell you, you are not good enough. You will find a mentor, a teacher, a friend. But until you do not; believe in yourself. You won’t grow courage, discover methods and rightly calculate consequences.\np: None in this world will believe in you, if you do not believe. If you sell your call time, night walks and prescriptions for no cost; no one will value it for you. No one will honor your sweating. None around you will respect your greetings. If you put a stop today to, selling the tiny parts of your life, Free, you will find the impact of believing in yourself.\np: Believe in yourself. And that is it. You are, what you think of yourself. You do not need validation. You do not need guidance. You do not need empathy and claps. You have it already. You have your canvas, your pen and your time, to draw the best painting in the world. You have focus, to write the best book out there. You have your laptop to write the best programs in the world.\np: Unless you believe in yourself, you do not stand a chance at making your roar louder in this crowd. The crowd will over run you. It will suffocate you. It will beat you to your knees. It will tell you, you lost sanity, and at this moment, other than the “believe” in yourself — none will help you.\nh3: Conclusion\np: We all love each other. We all care about each other. We all want to help. We all want to hold on to our peddles, row together, steer our ship out of the storm. We all know, we are going through our storm.\nWe fail, when we stop admitting it. When we let pride steer our life. We fail, when we let our need of validation control us, paint it with sweet words and rub it on others’ faces. We fail, when we let superficial smiles, fake likes and meaningless follower-counts, control our actions.\np: A dislike, a moment of silence, a period of no claps, and some duration of no money, does not mean you are lacking / lagging / failing. It is a moment to teach you, you are sailing all on your own. It is some place, invisible, teaching you, you are enough alone. You are enough success, enough happy, enough health. It teaches you, you alone can live fine. You alone, if believe in yourself, can beat it all.\np: I know, you label me insane, but what is sane. What and who and why and how and wheres. I do not find answers anywhere else, but in Quran. I do not find it anywhere, but in the life of Prophet PBUH.\np.note: Love yourself.",

        "body": "h1: Things to do when home alone\np.note: I am alone home. No responsibility, job or family. I feel, I can fly. Let’s discuss how you can live a live-ly day, when you are home alone?\nh3: 1 — Eat the Frog\np: Because these are the starting days of your leave, you are going to find ample amount of time to procrastinate. Things you wanted to do earlier, while you were dodging bullets at your job, are now here, waiting for your command to get done-d. You thought, “off days” will make it easier for you to pick a fork and turn wise eat away these goals? You were wrong. You are going to face a full blown attack of procrastination. It is going to make you lazy, feel stupid and look weird. You will need to kill this or eat this frog the first thing in your day — if you want to survive your days on leave.\np: The right way to fix it is “eat the frog” approach. You wake up early in the morning. You cherry pick one most gruesome task [that leads to your dream goal]. You eat this frog the first. If you had two frogs to eat today. Eat the bigger one first. You do not plan ahead; what frogs you will eat tomorrow or what frogs you plan to eat in this month. Let your instincts decide on which frog to eat, every day in the morning.\np: Ok.. roll on to the next thing you can do.\nh3: 2 — Have a sweet interaction\np: You did a bulky activity, the frog eating, even on your leave?\nIt was needed to keep you feeling fulfilled. Next you can do a simple / relatively easier task. Talk to someone on your relatively high priority agenda on a phone call. We have phones, so I suggest resort to phone call session instead of real life physical pro-longed not fun meetings.\np: You can speak your heart out about the issue at hand. You can make your loved ones laugh with your stupid jokes. You can fight with a distant cousin. You can listen to somebody in trouble. Or you can throw a coin [any topic] in the air and let the discussion roll itself.\nh3: 3 — Watch a good movie\np: You are tired. Half the day is over. You need to feel lighter, relieved and calm. You should put your last night’s pizza in oven, fill your cup with Coke and decide on a good title to watch.\np: Create good ambience around it. Put your phone on airplane mode. Lock all the noise outside. Sit, watch, eat and feel lively with your favourite comedian or a bold science-fiction-cum-love story.\np: My favourite titles in fiction-cum-love-stories category are\np.b-left: Adjustment Bureau\np.b-left: Upside Down\np.b-left: Runaway Jury\np.b-left: Non Fiction · How do you know [available on Netflix]\nh3: Concluding the Day\np: I think most part of your day is over. You are left with few hours to eat, chit chat, ponder over your yesterday and fork your future tasks.\np: The key is — do the the bulky task first thing in the morning. Bulky; something that keeps you accountable or tells you, you have moved few steps ahead on your growth graph. Keep it under an hour, if you do not want to overload yourself, but under no circumstances, avoid the frog.\np: Your day is done. You did a good job. You can take a good nap. For that, make sure you sleep maximum by 10 O’Clock at night. Any time after this deadline, can prove unhealthy and weird for you the next day.",

        "body": "h1: Let’s redo the resolution of 365 days of writing one article everyday\np.note: Reason is, only that — I started losing interest in living a healthy life style. It was going good, I thought I needed rest. But, I feel now, growing is the only lifestyle that matters. And growing without worrying about creating a bad impression is the right way to Live. So, let’s start the article with one thing I learnt today.\np.quote: \"Or lest it say when it sees punishment, \"If only I had another turn so I could be among the doers of good\". — Surah Az Zumar, Verse 58\np: According to Allah, the God, the Creator of heavens and earth, there is very limited time. We are in fact out of time.\np: Whether we are in our teenage-hood or we are near the retirement; there is no time to sit angry, deny the reality and run after fake sources of pleasure.\np: Pleasure includes all things that are of no use out there:-\np.b-left: TV is throwing trash at us.\np.b-left: Social media is spreading harmful envy.\np.b-left: Phone calls and messages are putting a burden.\np.b-left: Jobs are putting a strain on our healths .\np: We, human beings, when walk with our eyes closed, hurt none but ourselves. We are full of enemies. Neither do we have time to beat them, nor do we have the courage to beat them. We need a continuous influx of motivation, light and energy to walk the right path.\nh3: What is the right path?\np: It is to write articles. Or you can learn to code. Or you can start a side hustle to bring in some uncertainty. Or you can go off-grid and do cliff diving.\np: The right path, we all know, is to do the right thing. It can be building muscles or it can be finding contentment. But it is not sitting idle and waiting for the right idea to click; and get to work.\np: Right ideas do not click. Right goals do not click. Right method of earning money and carving a path till the end does not occur.\nh3: Come on guys\np: If you can not do a side hustle. Or if you can not find a way to beat your cravings. Just download a 30 days challenge calendar and get going with physical fitness.\np: Or pick a course on Udemy and build the best carpenter shop in your neighbourhood.\np: Or learn to code and create one good portfolio.\np: But, do not sit idle. It is harmful, dangerous and rots you inside out.\nh3: Conclusion\np: It is my first blog of the next series. It is my second effort of making a 365 day streak possible. My first attempt was 191 days [with nearly 10 days missed in between].\np: I am ok. Life is good. And it is a small mission, that has the potential to transform into a somewhat bigger mission. For now, if you want to support me, only buy my monthly meetup tickets. Your presence will lit our space brighter.\np: Wish you, Happy days ahead.",

        "body": "h1: What it feels like when you get out of rabbit hole of Excessive Thinking and No Action ?\np.note: I went into a rabbit hole of failures, short sightedness and useless planning for nearly a month. Now I have realised; It is the action that separates us from failure. Lack of action distorts our view and ultimately throws us into an un-ending stream of confusions / noise and questions.\np: To save your time, this article revolves around 3 x things. Things that change at once after you take a committed action.\np.b-left: 1. You get mixed feelings of Anxiety and Contentment\np.b-left: 2. Influx of ideas 💡 and big thoughts\np.b-left: 3. You immediately put a check on your Time Management\nh3: 1 — What is anxiety filled Contentment\np: It is heart pumping, nervousness and a constant fear of failure. You try to hold on to ways, means and beliefs to make sure this time you do not deviate. It is a fight with the inner devil where you are holding the devil on its back, flat on ground. It is breathing right in your face and you fear it gets back up and takes you down.\np: When you take a decisive action, the fear of devil 👿 dominates you — it leads to anxiety. But the contentment of finally getting into action, keeps you going.\np: This moment is quiet, liberating and calm.\np: If you are not finding it calm, it means, your inner devil is taking back its hold on you.\nh3: 2 — What is my Influx of ideas 💡?\np: As I am starting journaling my run away from devil and it is my 2nd day. My influx of ideas are as under. I know they are stupidly big, but these are wide open windows that I can decide on and get to working. The immediate ones (plans) I am feeling are as under:-\np.b-left: 1. Make a streak website like I did in my first attempt.\np.b-left: 2.  What are ways, I can take willing writers on board with me.\np.b-left: 3. Learn email marketing to grow mailing list.\np.b-left: 4. Convert articles into a paper back book — if nothing else works.\np: These are the kind of thoughts that dominate you when you get into action. A rush, some rapid heart beat and flow of confusing yet useful ideas. It gets easier to hit the flow state. And life starts giving vibes of good productivity and creativity at once.\np: You can join me by making a commitment right now, to start journaling Or start a fitness challenge. And you will find similar pump / motivation and hope.\nh3: 3 — How action relates to Time Management ?\np: With open eyes you do not walk hasty. You can see the repercussions. Immediately ideas dominate you and you have the tinkering feel of contentment — you will not be willing to give up on it.\np: In a state of fear, your first response is to find time. Build energy around this bracket of your day. Wake up, eat breakfast, make tea or walk in the street — the time you selected for one thing in your resolution, occupies you.\np: You will become cautious of your actions around this time of day, when you put your goal into action. And you will start managing your life, unconsciously in the right way.\np: Time will increase. Spaces of boredom will come eating at you. Your talks will not have depth.\np: At the beginning, You will walk and not be able to live a fun life.\np: The beginning is hard. Because you feel aroused, addicted, dull and in a state of continuous fight — like you are sitting in a rehab center.\np: As you build control your sources of addictions take a quick turn. You start to take responsible decisions. And ultimately you start managing your days better.\nh3: What comes next?\np: Chart, mark, draw and foster a nice plan. You are now on the road to winning — why not win it the best.\np: Write a good plan that you can monetise the new action. It can take a day or a week. But do not get into another action, unless you have a foreseeable way of monetising it.\np: For me, it is making the subscription platform and market my meetups. A website seems like a sound plan. But before getting into coding and distributing — I am sketching some mockups.\np: You can also pick the one niche you want to master. Get into action. Write a plan. And get growing.",

        "body": "h1: Why I can't take No for an answer ?\np.note: I am done with people screaming “consistency is the key”, “goal is an answer to my prayers” and “I need to get out of my 9 to 5 work routine”. None are humble, know, what I am going through.\np: We humans, need nothing in here. We have enough health, clothes and money in our pockets. We do not need a mission. We do not need a goal. We do not need more. To be honest, we have enough.\nh3: What really do we need?\np: We need Peace, calmness, less noise and honest ears. We, novice, people do not need opportunities and we do not want to feel like we are your product. We need you to look at us like heart felt humans.\np: Give us space, if you can not give us anything else. Just let us walk, with our headphones on, on long straight walkways. Let us get lost in our own dreams, motions and moments of flow.\np: Let us live, like humans, like novice, like mission-less and aimless kids.\nh3: What makes me happy?\np: The living in the moment gives me chills. Right now, in this part, the indie hacker podcast in my ears and the air touching me — is all I need to be happy. It is good. And it is enough.\np: The one thing that makes me feel great, is able to know there is more and in the whole wide world, none have the answer to it. Even those on TV shows and great scholars in Youtube, does not know, what is out there. The realisation of everybody-is-faking-it keeps me afloat.\np: I know life has fun and it is not open to me yet. I know, the charisma, the grace and sincerity is out there — but not open to me yet. I know, things are great, ahead, around the next corner of my life's route.\np: I feel chilled, haste-full and hurried, to move my arm forward and get a hold of it. I just can’t hold myself shorter, smaller or weaker and miss out the fun this life has to offer me.\nh3: I just can’t take No for an answer\np: I know it is tough, to speak to people while they do not want to listen. I know, my blogs are weak and not fun. I know my tweets are rubbing right up at your face. I know, my projects are weak and I know these are nothing but failures.\np: But, I do not know how to stop. I just can’t take No, for an answer. I tell myself nothing is fixed, and I do not show up to really fix it. But, I do not know anything else — other than keeping my head low, hope high and grip tight.\nh3: Conclusion\np: The country I am from, Pakistan, is good. Fertile land. Humble people. Sufficient water. Snow in the north and oil in the south.\np: It is not heading like I want it to move forward. It is not making my life easier yet. It doesn’t promote healthy discussions, productive hours, sober community gatherings and good-enough welfare organisations. My country is not yet Fixed. My home, your home, everybody’s home is not fixed.\nRoads broken, poverty hit, head scratching parents and kids lost on tinder — is not the way, I dreamt of our land.\np: I am sorry, for being abusive, pointy and blunt at times, but I can’t stop, until, I unite all of our people who want to talk good, live good and feel good.",

        "body": "h1: There are no rules in our life\np.note: Just saw this movie — Collateral. Tom Cruise dies in the Subway. And he is an assassin. Watching such scenes gives me an ache for murderers, looters and deceits — who were fighting the Society and died on their run. We labelled them wrong!\np: Rules do not exist. They are vague, imperfect, dodgy and superficial. You are a racist in Pakistan, you can lead a community here. You are a muslim in America, you can lead an institution.\np: Our regions define rules. Some times politicians define them. Mostly it is a society that has bombarded its myths over us while we were young. And we grew into a bad product of its vague statures.\np.quote: It is true — there are no rules.\nh3: But there got to be some limits to which we can take an action?\np: If you can [you are capable of] spending the rest of your life in confinement, you are free to do all things. All things include murder, steal, rape or smuggle.\np: But if you are ok with your current circumstances. And your elders, society or siblings do not pinch you. And you think life is in good shape. You can live a good life — starting today. You are free to do your job, stay quiet, do not take a risk, bring in profits or get old in your current shape.\np: It never happens, I have not met a person who is satisfied with his current circumstances.\np: Normal life has its rent. You got to pay it. And If you want to lead the constitution or write your own, you got to be WILLING to sit in a confinement for the rest of your life. Confinement is Prison with no movies, job, wife, family or car. It is a reality. And you got to be brave to fight your fears.\nh3: Luckily — there is a sweet middle spot in between the two extremes.\np: 1st :- Accept the losses you can not afford. Label yourself coward, loser or failure in those areas of life which you fear to fight head on. When someone asks you, instead of giving justifications tell him upfront, you have fears.\np: Next :- When you see a murderer, label him brave and call yourself coward. When you see a rapist, label him strong. When you see a black, a slave, a weak, or one in chains, in stead of giving him / her bad names — label him more powerful than you are and accept your defeat.\np: Last :- Now define your limits. The things that you are willing to lose. Create a circle ⭕️. Inside this circle you know you can afford risks. Here you should live / die / rape or steal. The circle inside which you are ok with the repercussions and consequences.\np: In your circle, try higher jumps. Sometimes act bold. At times speak louder. Win weird names, Live loose and do not get out of the circle, ever.\nh3: What is this Circle to me?\np: I feel it is Quran. It allows me to pack my bag and move out — go nomad. It allows me to fight good. It allows me to die quick, early and big. It allows me all things that transform places, spaces and people.\np: I feel great, once, I am inside it. Outside this circle there are things that are proven wrong; mafia, societal norms and junk. Outside Quran, are all weird things, we have become habitual of pursuing.\nh3: Strong Suggestion\np: To be honest, these journals, are just that \"journals\". Where I talk to myself and convince myself to get into a certain kind of action.\np.bold: What suggestion do I give myself today?\np: I would tell my-self\np: Take the jump everyday. Do one thing stupid everyday. Something that is not normal and it is ok according to Quran. That way I might manage to bring people together. That way I might print a book. That way, I might convert my local mosque into a cool co-working space.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Dream stupidly big. When your circle is small, let your brain wander into places that give you chills. Liberate your self — in your thoughts at least.\np: Dreaming gives imagination. Imagination gives plans. Plans gives intelligence. Intelligence gives confidence. And confidence brings in happiness, consistency and mission.\nLive good. Like the leaders of the world. Stop limiting yourself — because your mother underestimated you, or your friends bullied you. You still are a wonderful human being, capable of living to your best potentials. You can become a comedian, or a dancer, or a speaker, or a ferrari formula 1 driver. You can become all things. You are enough. You need good people around you. You need claps, ovation and encouragement. You are done with the negation and bulliesm. You need to live, get back on your feet and dance.\np: You need to define your own circle, inside which their are no rules",

        "body": "h1: How to become an effective executive ?\np.note: I have been reading “Effective Executive” by Peter Drucker and, it is calling out loud for \"hardwork\". Whereas according to my egoistic beliefs; lazy work, leads to a Fun-Filled Work Space.\np: Most of my colleagues, their fathers, and relatives are executives. They are leading workspaces, people, and problems. But almost all of them, in spite of the hard work, are living a miserable life.\nh3: How do we make it all Fun, Productive and Easy?\np: The secret lies in Lazy Work.\np: Remember three principles are there to lead all kinds of organisations. Focus on these 3 x principles, next time you are sitting in your executive chair.\np.b-left: 1. Ask people their individual life missions and entertain them that they do not give up.\np.b-left: 2. Do not do the hard work.\np.b-left: 3. Keep things Simple — to the point.\nh3: 1 — Ask people their life goals\np: It seems like an easy task. But it demands an enormous amount of self discipline to finally become a listener.\np: If you are an executive, follow this rule.\np.bold: Listen first, Speak last.\np: Let people in your organisation breathe, think and cheer up. Ask them of their individual goals and encourage them.\np: Some will feel opting wrong missions, weird goals and meaningless purposes. But let them pursue their goals.\np.quote: It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. <br> — Aristotle\np: Entertain the people around you, even when they are crazy bad or usually get on your nerves.\np: You will make them your friends, colleagues and win their respect. Happy people under you will transform your work environment. Your people will love your presence. You will love your mornings for things will start happening your way.\np.bold: Effective executives are good friends.\nh3: 2 — Do not do the hard work — ever !\np: All great things happen with a conscience heart, calm mind and quiet space.\np: We humans can not focus on two things at once. We can not breathe easily in a distracted environment. We can not live fun, with hard work — up on our shoulders.\np: Take it all off. Shed away all the hard work.\np: Your priority number 1 is also not worth a toll on your health. Your most difficult job is not worth your time. Your most crazy and big opportunity is not worth a dime.\np: If something is putting a burden on your graceful life style, it is not worth your attention.\np: Live sober, happy and fun. Death can wait.\nh3: 3 — Keep your favorite task — simple\np: We are incited by our crazy ideas and it leads us to drawing complicated solutions.\np: As an idea hits you. Or a solution sparks in your head, try to absorb it. Take it slow and gradual. Do not change existing course of action, unless your new idea is fully absorbed and understood.\np: Halt before getting into action. Ask yourself, if living is fun enough. Does the new method bring in more fun. Does it exist on the same road, your life goals sits at. Is it cool. Is it great enough, as you felt it at the beginning. Some days later you will not hate it ?\np: Next, start finding the simplest and most elegant way of doing it. Think about it during your evening walks and morning rituals.\np: When you are finally able to create a sober and simple solution to transform this idea into a reality — transform it.\np: Bring in your team. Show them your passion. Control your air. Breathe fun. Encourage yourself. Convince them this new idea is fun, simple and will make you rich.\np: As you talk good, cool and respectful, things start churning. You and your organisation start earning more. And fruits of old-age classic executive lifestyle comes flowing in.\np: Under no circumstances, your subordinates are your employees. They are your team-mates. They are your friends. And you always respect their mission, life and freedom.",

Everytime I call them, they pick up, fight with me, buy / show an intent to buy one and after hardcore sessions — I make the sale.\np: Character is happiness. It is taking control of your life and leading it out of chaos through discipline, self control and continuous personal evaluation.\np: One can not grow happy, with out building a good character underneath. Clever people do go higher, but at some point of their life they peak. Their formulas fail. They lose the grace. And they get boring.\np: Honest people, who talk about what they feel inside their hearts, always win. They always get rich. They always feel good. Under failure they smile. And usually they are winners.\nh3: What is money ?\np: Money is the trust your people put in you. If you want to evaluate your self-worth, create an event on facebook, put 5 USD ticket on it, and share in your circle.\np: Your tickets sold is your actual self worth. Or you can say, that is the amount of trust, your people will be putting in you. My self worth is currently 25 USD. Because I sold 5 tickets for my tomorrow’s event.\np: With money, you can do self evaluation.\nh3: If you want to grow — wiser it is to grow while raising self-worth\np: We need money to an extent we can keep it in a state of flow. It will allow us to help our cause, mission or goal. To increase the sources of income, you need a solid business ? Wrong ! You need a solid character.\np: At times, you will get in fights with people near you and other times, you will be labelled crazy, stupid or mad.\np: In these hours of uncertainty in your struggle, you will need to hold your ground stronger.\np: Growing character gives you this courage to stand strong. You manage to take the hits and still walk smiling.\np: The amount of confidence you return to hits, grows your sources of money. It increases its meaning. And its investments make you a happy investor.\nh3: Money is a by product of a transparent lifestyle\np: Consider yourself a saint, a priest or an imam. As you are sitting alone, when none is watching you, you are the best version of yourself.\np: As you turn your isolations into fun, you transform. Your growth gives you confidence. You living feels good. You can keep the smile broader when facing your people. You can now lead them. Or you can run towards your goals with a hardened force of resilience.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Watch movies, read books, take caffeine in your blood and write journals. But do not do the slightest thing, you are afraid you can not carry with you in public.\np: Live sober, transparent and saint — in your loneliness. And live the worst image of yourself — in your people. It will make you richer in wealth, contentment and happiness.",

        "body": "h1: My life was in shambles and pursuit of happiness gave it colors\np.note: Everything was a chaos for a very long time. I, being from Pakistan, am a perfect victim of my education system. I listened to protocol centred voices and ran in pursuit of ugliest kind of goals — power, money and name on leaders' board. I fell hard.\np: My life was filled with porn, music, cigarettes, late night drivings and high ambitions. Every morning I wore a honourable Man’s mask and went to my job. Every day I walked with high head, low self-esteem, bad confidence and a fake smile on my face [to avoid encounters].\np: I was perfectly accepted by my profession, elders and society.\np: Boom ! I got divorced. I became an outsider. I got isolated. And all, left me on my own. It all came down to re-evaluating myself from ground up. I had lived most of my life by this day, actually 30 years of hard work’s life. And at this point, re-evaluating everything from ground up was a risky thing to do.\np: It is life — you got to choose at some point which side you are on.\nh3: Pursuit of happiness\np: It is not money, not health, not rank, not power and not at all 100 days of non-stop physical challenge in the gym. I have done all the challenges and enjoyed almost all the power in the world. Nothing saved me back then from falling and nothing can save me from hitting rock bottom in future also.\np: Irrespective of the certainty you add or the wall you build around you, the bottom of this world is always open to you. And no matter what you do, you can still fall down, real bad. \np: If you do not stop and re-draw your plan to live your life your way, you will keep hitting down. And you will keep making your existence a little more miserable.\np: The only reliable way of finding happiness is — growing ONE step every day.\nh3: What is my colour\np: I love sincerity, honesty, one face personality, abnormality and stupidity. The childhood-ness in people, I love it. And I hate, people becoming or acting the older-Me-way.\np: My colours are becoming a good person, accepting the failures and announcing them in wide open like you are standing naked in the crowd. My colours are to take a pause from my most favourite work and breathe air, serenity and calmness. My colours are quietness, humility and love.\np: I am a staunch follower of Gandhi’s statement\np.quote: “Happiness is when; what you think, what you speak and what you do are in harmony.” <br> — Gandhi\np: So is everybody’s life. Some manage to gather courage to speak their heart out. Some fail to find the meaning and keep running towards the dark hole of a greater rank, bigger fort or a stable life, all our life.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Life never gets stable. If somebody claims it is stable, he is lying. We are humans and we never manage to find that un-breakable point we strive all our life.\np: Let your life be like it is \"right now\". Do not try to change the things that are beyond your control. Find a quiet place around you, sit there, listen to bird chirps and reflect on your bad habits that stop you from growing every day. And then — GROW !\np: Grow in calmness, humility, humbleness, truthfulness and love. And let the world around you, fix your future for you.",

        "body": "h1: Get out of hustle culture right now to live longer and happier\np.note: I am warning you! If you continue to invest yourself in your goal, mission, ambition, destination, while compromising on your health, serenity, peacefulness — it is going to take a toll on your lifestyle. You might die sooner or you might end up ruining your priorities.\np: It is important we define our priorities at the earliest-stage-possible of our life. The earliest for you is, today, right now. Define the priority, write it on a piece of paper and forget what your elders told you. Forget where you were running towards. Forget the hard work you have put in building your today. Forget the money you poured in. Forget all of it, and get back to living according to your priorities.\np: If you are not happy — restart. You are not late.\nh3: Pakistan and the rest of the World\np: Pakistan, is a developing nation. We believe in Western culture to some extent. It is obvious; better and bigger roads, well-refined welfare systems and stable economies. We do not know a way very different than what West promotes.\np: We have become a victim of Western Media propagating Hustle Culture.\np: In Pakistan, we believe, it is important to first make sure we have security to some extent. We will first secure a Job, then we secure a rank, and then we secure a good retirement package. And one day we wake up, Cursing West.\np: It is not because of Media, entirely. Mostly, it is our Fear. This phenomenon of “imposing limits on ourselves” is hurting us a lot. Limits such as: —\np.b-left: 1. Our actions can’t change much.\np.b-left: 2. We are a poor country and we can not afford much risk.\np.b-left: 3. Excelling in career is the only way we can win stability.\np.b-left: 4. I alone am nothing. Because our system is being controlled by a bigger force.\np.b-left: 5. Allah will fix it for us. We are only supposed to deliver His message.\np: These are limits which define our extent of Freedom. If you can re-write your priorities, you can re-define your limits also.\nh3: We need to set our directions straight\np: Most youngsters are failing today. Depression is hitting us hard. Young employees are dying of heart attack. And  we are collapsing every second. This is a stage where we need to set our directions straight.\nh3: Get out Right Now\np: I can not emphasise on it any more.\np: You do not have to worry, be afraid or live under somebody’s else’s rules. You are a free person. And if you think, some rules, or contracts, limit your freedom, you are wrong. Only your fear limits you.\np.b-left: 1. Get out of fear of losing, right now.\np.b-left: 2. Draw your priorities in your life.\np.b-left: 3. Place relationships at the top.\np.b-left: 4. Place your health at 2nd.\np.b-left: 5. Place your comfort and luxury at the last.\np: Do not work, do not run, do not sweat — if you were doing it for somebody else.\np: Get back on your feet. Fight your fear right now. Run on your own beaten road. Grow guts to fight your fear yourself. Fight what you thought was yours and somebody else took it from you. Straighten up a little.\nWorst? Become an outcast, if this is what it takes, to win back the lost freedom.\nh3: What comes right after you take action ?\np: The next thing, that comes, is happiness. Honestly, the day you find out, it was not money that brought you comfort but the power to change yourself right now, that day you become happy. Truly and fulfilled. It turns the tides for you and you start building your own world from ground up.\np: I am telling you from my personal experience of building techshek community. It is a platform where I do what I love. Inside this territory, I dance, I chat, I talk, I make friends and I at no point stop living. This community gives me the power to breathe good and laugh good-er.\np: I do not find serene outside this belief I have discovered over my failures : —\np.quote: “I have the ability to change the course of my life the way I want, where I want, how I want, at any moment of my life”.\np: Addictions are out, bad habits are out, poverty is out and success is out. Inside this circle, I am roaming happy.\np: If you want to be happy, you do not need money, you only need good riddance of your bad habits. You do not need hard work to get rid of these actions that drag you down. You need the ability to Stop when you are tired. The ability to relax when you feel you are burdened. The ability to feel Ok when you know the losses are taking you down and deep inside you believe — you are going to get back on your feet.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Ask me! Life is not hustle. It is easy. You can watch movies all day long. Or you can go for a picnic trip to North. But at no point of time, Life is not “Not Fun”.\np: The Hustle culture of the West is finding its ways into our \"desi\" society. We are unable to think rational and we are overburdening ourselves un-necessarily. Bigger bags to school, bigger brief-cases to offices, and bigger plans / spread sheets / power point presentations are breaking us really bad.\np: These are false lies. These are only demanding in an old-age, worn out and a pathetic culture. Such burden does not bring creative ideas and easy solutions or sober livings. These do not fix anything.\np: The only fix to a happy society, is calmness, good health, silence and private circle of your own. Build these circles where no one is allowed to enter, and you stand out “happier” in your choice of crowd.",

        "body": "h1: Why we asians fail ?\np.note: What is one thing that pinched me today ? I will be mentioning its root causes and affects on our routine life. And I will try to motivate you to take back the Control… Fix dilemma and contribute a major Fix to our society.\np: It is not wealth problem, neither contentment of heart nor broken infrastructure and not at all poverty. The biggest dilemma today that is eating us from our roots is — Back Stab Culture.\np: We do not back stab any one willingly at the beginning. In the beginning, it is spicy discussion, like Junk Food — tastes good on its first bite. And always, we lose track of time, while enjoying the spicy-ness, crookedness and hookedness of gossip. And every time we end up with, someone back stabbed.\np: Best thing is, in our culture, we think we Won. We damaged the reputation. We also spent some good time. We keep encouraging ourselves, \"we lived a good day\" for a brief moment of time on our dinner discussion. But — HELLO — you did something real bad.\nh3: What actually happened while you were backstabbing someone else?\np: You sunk your soul a little further down. You broke the intact part of your body — that gave depth to your smiles. You have hurt your own (any human’s) blue print.\np: You did not have fun discussion — while back bitting. You ruined your own time, health, money and growth meter, while stabbing some body else.\np: Later you might go for a jog, you might sweat on a treadmill, or you might go swimming — the damage done is still there. Hanging right on your chest. It will be haunting you in times to come. It has left some ugly marks on your Fulfilment meter. Unless, you go right in front of that person you have hit, you do no Fix the guilt you caused yourself.\nh3: Lesson —\np.quote: Always talk up-front, bold, ugly and truthful. It will save you your guilt and it will actually grow your image.\nh3: Do not break your soul — while it is still intact\np: I published a video in order to market my last meetup. People in my circle, downloaded this video, labelled it bad names, and propagated me — as a beggar — asking for money.\np: I am happy. It gave them spice, and it gave me a Blog Idea. One good WIN for me.\np: I strongly suggest you, do not damage your soul. It is a temple. It is clean. It lives in serenity and silence. Keep it at it — the best work it does. Do not harm its peacefulness and do not hurt your growth.\nh3: Were we meant for this ? Laying on Ground ?\np: You were meant to be brave, act mature, love nature, learn living and win your negotiations. You were not meant to win mere arguments and some podiums. You were bigger than all the crazy, below the belt talks. You were born beautiful. Your mother loved you. You grew into a full human being. You made friends. You gave birth to kids. You enjoyed your life's run.\np: You had all the fun while living your life. I accept, you lost some battles, and you wanted to stop at some point. I also accept, your hustle is worst — I can't imagine.\np: But if you are from Asia, or India, or Pakistan, one thing you can do right now to actually contribute towards betterment of our nations; stop back stabbing people who trust you. Stop hurting people who want to grow their weird ideas with you. Stop putting barricades in people’s path who love you. Stop telling them they are wrong. And stop hammering them.\nh3: Conclusion\np: If you ask me, I love my life. It is a blog post. Some minutes before, it was a website idea. In the morning we had a sweet class session to learn to code. My life is good and happy, at its roots.\np: You can also live good and grow your richness of heart — by following your dreams. You follow your passion, brake the barrier and superficial definitions of Aim / Goal imposed on you by your elders. Honestly, you will be breaking some real big shackles holding you down. You will feel the freedom and the extent to which you really can take the flight. And you will feel the breeze of success in the moment.\np: Else, you will die like most. On a death bed, bad face, a worried heart and no more relations.",

Like at this moment, I have made myself believe, \"I am a journalist covering Life related articles for a big news agency\".\r\np: We work in states. Mornings are filled with fresh ideas. Day time with workload. Night with Netflix. But in all times, whether hard or easy, we are able to move that keeps us afloat the life's wheel.\r\np: Just like we control our emotional states that are independent of the circumstances. Our brains also gather incentives, and brings them to its own advantage. You got to make your brain work in sync with your body.\r\np: If you are finding it difficult to find an idea that you can write about— bring out your inner frustration, anger or awkwardness. The anger and frustration, will put forth a list of topics you can write about.\r\np: But if you are sitting sober, nothing frustrating or no losses, you will only be writing a good dictionary page. That will hardly have a point and will be nothing, but another boring blog post.\r\nh3: 1 — Trigger the Pain inside you\r\np: Find your motive. If you never failed, become a Failure. Start a new initiative, market it, and make sure it turns into your humiliation.\r\np: The Failure, or thinking about failures, triggers the pain you have hid deep inside. It brings out the real you. One who is not afraid of losing reputation.\r\np: All writers, artists, great singers, poets and painters, put a story into their work. The story has a meaning. It always is an honest expression of anger. Stories always end with a precise solution statement.\r\np: When you open your heart to the audience for evaluation and judgement — it makes finding ideas for your next article easier.\r\nh3: Lesson —\r\nquote: Express yourself openly, without worrying about the repercussions or results.\r\nh3: 2 — Always Start even when you feel you are dull and dead\r\np: I was reading a blog post, where the author mentions all mantras, life coaches, todo lists and motivational speeches have one thing in common — they provoke you to take the first step.\r\np: It means, you do not need the coach to find the good idea to write about. It only demands, taking the first step. Picking up the pen, looking towards it and start moving your hands. \r\np: Slowly you will have a baseline sketch, that you can use to build the skeleton upon and finally you will be in your Flow State to decorate its interiors, fonts, flow and colors. \r\np: Taking the first step is the secret to nearly all good things. The first step to all kinds of difficult works, is the only difficult part of the work. As you take this first step, you are in, water is over your head, you are lost in your brain and you are now writing like you love to write.\r\nh3: 3 — Keep your living organised\r\np: Writing does not come from good vocabulary and better education. It comes from experiences. You do not manage to build experiences around you, unless you clean the inside out of your own soul.\r\np: Lift your standard of living, enforce clear lines and restrictions, and you will be riding smooth to your Productivity Zone.\r\np: Build in an organised way of living. You sleep on time and you wake up early. The best time of the day is meant to be noise-less, interruption less and burden-less. I find it in my mornings. Everyone is sleeping and I am open to bringing all kinds of ideas to sketches.\r\np: If you want to start writing, I suggest, do it in the morning. After you meditate and you are now sailing fine in your thoughts. Put your thoughts on a paper, punch its title above it, download a nice image from Unsplash and publish it on Medium.\r\np: You will be ok — after some time. As the dreadful and difficult phase of building the hobby is over, you will be finding yourself at a relatively cleaner, productive and calm place.\r\nh3: Conclusion\r\np: Living has to be Fun. Fun does not come with out maintaining the Focus. And Focus demands leap of faith, trusting your inner guts and taking the big sure-death jump of your life.\r\np: Writing blogs is a hobby for you. It is exactly like building mental muscles or putting your body into shape. All hobbies are boring in the beginning, but as you start putting it into practice, things start making sense.\r\np: Slowly you grow audience. It turns into a monetary benefit. And you can liberate yourself of shackles of fake smiles, weird late night gatherings and absurd thoughts.\r\np: Take the first step. Make it hit the floor hard. Every morning, funnel your thoughts on a piece of paper. Write without worrying about your image, results and analytical figures.\r\np: Just write, because other than picking a pen and making it move on paper, there really is no way to start.",

Or we say — unless we take significant amount of action we won’t change.\np: If you isolate your journey from your destination and try to beautify only the path to the destination. You will realise your path doesn’t demand excessive hard work, worrying or  planning.\np: If the world is trying to convince us, take mega actions to fix our lives, it doesn’t mean it is the right thing to do. Out of 100, 99 times the world has been wrong. So, stop believing in the mob and start thinking. Our world has created some bad-insane-strange myths such as : —\np.b-left: 1. With hard work — you will stand out.\np.b-left: 2. With rank — you will change the bad(s) in your community.\np.b-left: 3. With compromises — you will build better relationship.\nh3: You are not for sale\np: You are not for sale. Pin it to your chest. You are not meant to bow down, lower your ego, walk humble when you are treated like trash.\np: You are a human being. You have a birth right to live a life of Freedom. No one can snatch it from you. And no one can tell you to “1st Deserve”.\np: You do not need to put in hard work to grow into a better yourself. It is blatant wrong and it is only a bubble about to burst.\np: If you ask me, the challenges you will face when trying to change your course, your way of working or building your own platform are not at all related to hard work. These are\np.b-left: 1. Good riddance of bad habits\np.b-left: 2. Adopting to Upfront lifestyle\np.b-left: 3. Managing to trust your instincts\nh3: 1 — What is Good Riddance of bad habits\np: Bad habits include intake of alcohol, smoking, dependance on music, pornography and back biting.\np: It is not time wastage, not sitting on couch all day, not laziness and not sleeping more than necessary. You may play games all day. Or you may sit useless doing nothing most of the day. You still does not fall in the block of “bad people” doing \"bad stuff\".\np: If your dad wants you to get a job and you do not find one and you fail. It does not make you bad. It means your dad is putting unnecessary expectations on you. You are now mature — you can decide the wrongs and rights well on your own.\np: Dad becoming hard on you, or community bullying you, will turn you into a person — who will end up negating the worldly established beliefs. You will be frustrated so much from the bullying, you will learn in the process. And slowly you will learn to channel yuor anger. And once you master it — you will become someone creating products. After the product, you will have left an impact.\np: The real bad[s] in us, are not the ones portrayed bad by the people around us. The real bads are only those things that hurt the peacefulness of our soul.\np: Get rid of all bad habits. Rid good fast sooner and you will find, your time wasting and lousy sittings will turn into productive hours of creative work.\np: Self control is the most precious asset you will gather in your Life.\nh3: 2 — Adopting to Upfront Life Style\np: Make talking your heart to people easier. Isolation ruins our thinking process. It fills our head with negative thoughts. And it always leads to bad life choices.\np: Do not isolate yourself when you are in anger, regret or filled with guilt. Face the truth upfront.\np: You will damage some hearts. You will make people talk about you behind your back. You will annoy a lot more than you think.\np: But the truth is, you won’t carry much burden on your back. Such allegations and thwarts will not have much of a say in your life.\nh3: 3 —Trust your instincts\np: Right now, I felt, I should stop writing. Because no one reads my blogs and putting my [wonderful] thoughts into words is only a waste of time. I could have coded the next big app and got richer.\np: Such thoughts revolve around all kinds of rewarding works. When you put in your heart and soul into a job, it bears fruit.\nIt does not make you rich in money. Neither does it bring you any fame. Nor power. It only brings change. The change of “having no regrets”.\np: You change into a better person. You change the way you look towards your life. You change your priorities. You ask questions. And you seek, learn and grow.\nh3: Conclusion\np: I always say things like — live happy, fun and broader. I always tell my friends, colleagues and relatives to live good. I always promote one agenda, one way of life, one approach of thinking and resolving our problems — it is Change.\np: We are angry otherwise. Our kids are suffering otherwise. Our parents do not get the respect nor the facilities we intend giving them. We are usually a loser in our life — all of us.\np: But it doesn’t mean we need to put in ample amount of hard work to get out of misery.\np: It only means, you need to change the way you look at yourself and your life. As you start controlling your lifestyle your way, you will be sailing good — straight to your destination with out putting much of a hard work. It will have transformed into Passion Work.\np.bold: Good Life is a by-product of good habits.\np: After you change, you will not find any problem big enough to shake you up. Any loss, big enough to make you go crazy. Any failure, big enough to hurt your run.\np: You will become a happy guy, who lives good, even under circumstances where your are torn, and bullied.",

        "body": "h1: Making a useful Website\np.note: I am a web developer and I do not yet have any project in my portfolio yet. It is hard to make things that are actually useful. I confess; I am a Failure in this field even though I have been writing code for nearly 3 years now.\np: I will try to pen down my thoughts related to existing softwares we encounter nearly every day.\np.b-left: 1. Facebook. Not useful\np.b-left: 2. Twitter. Extremely useful\np.b-left: 3. Google. Extremely useful\np.b-left: 4. Microsoft. Not useful\np.b-left: 5. Apple. Not useful [in Pakistan]\np.b-left: 6. Youtube. Extremely Useful\nh3: Define Useful first\np.quote: Anything that does only one thing, it does it quick and it doesn’t irritate the customer.\nh3: How to find out what useful website you can build next ?\np.b-left: 1. Isolate yourself from shiny object syndrome.\np.b-left: 2. Pen down all good ideas that keeps eating you up. Beginner’s Ideas are usually the best.\np.b-left: 3. Out of all these ideas, which all seem attractive and fun to you?\np.b-left: 4. Draw mockups of these ideas.\np.b-left: 5. Design the product in Figma.\np.b-left: 6. Make it\nAnd\np.b-left: 7. Fail.\nh3: Why should you Fail ?\np: Because, it is not the goal that mattered to you. You did not work on this product to stand out in the market. Neither did you make it to help people fix a problem. Nor to make money.\nThe primary reason, you built it, is not the reward. If you try to control the impact as you start building it — you lost the Fun at its start. It is obvious failure. You will not enjoy the process.\np: To be precise, you need this website published — because the road is so much fun. You enjoy travelling this road where you create beautiful products filled with character and charisma.\nh3: Quality demands Focus\np: I find it hard to maintain focus when there is too much on my plate. More things spoil my mood. More work load spoils my work flow. More food, lowers my ability to keep my head straight.\np: I feel great working in a state of peacefulness. When I know the failures are ok. When I am affirmative, the losses are good. When I am able to separate myself from the destination. \np: Right now, this blog, turned into fun, because — it was halted since yesterday. I couldn’t find my motion, to put these words together. \np: I came out to the nearby park. I jogged, got sweaty and now hooked to ladybug’s podcast. Now I am laser focused on my phone sitting on this bench.\np: There is no noise stopping my thoughts, no people hindering, no traffic and no food. It is all good here. I feel liberated and focused.\np: I am unable to create anything without Focus. My talk deteriorates. My life starts becoming shaky. I do not find the right words. And I simply stop breathing my way.\np: If you want to build your website cleaner, make it without worrying about the results. Instead be worried; does building it gives you wings. Does it impact your laughter. Does it grow your confidence. Does it help you think deep. Does it make you feel cool.\np: Every one can wait, every your customers. Your deadlines and priorities can wait. If it is not made in a state of mindfulness — it simply can not turn into a quality product. You have to sit in a state where you are at your peak creativity.\nh3: What should you do if you can’t find focus?\np: Break the bad habits. Build good habits. Wake up early. Reduce your time on social media. Reduce the intake of ideas, suggestions and feedbacks. Reduce use of your mobile phone for somebody else. Cut down all things that are shiny — and are not sincerely proving beneficial to your life.\np: Slowly, it will give you time to think. In your thoughts and away from the wrongs — you will get super hyped. Passion will pave its way into your life. Fun will become your way of living. Your things will start changing. You will notice speaking loud, confident and fearless. It is going to change your physiology from ground up. And ultimately you are going to see your personalities touch inside your art. Like digital footprints of your personality.\nh3: For example\np: Your website, needs a good logo, a nice mission statement, great choice of colors, responsivity on all devices, thoughtfully built underlying logic and a reflection of your own personality.\np: I am building an ecommerce website these days. It needs good choice of colors. Good product photography with good placement of captions. And above everything it is meant to reduce the time it takes from landing on my e-commerce store to finally placing an order.\np: It needs a lot of thinking to make sure it doesn’t end just like any other e-commerce website. If it is meant to stand out, it should make sure it sells products faster, easier and nicer. Nothing more than that. If I am unable to put my focus in place, allow my creativity to surface, get into the shoes of an artist every day for nearly 2 hours — I don't believe I will ever be able to put forward this website.\nh3: Conclusion\np: That is it — let me conclude the steps to make sure your next Website works\np.b-left: 1. Get rid of bad habits\np.b-left: 2. Build focus\np.b-left: 3. Find a problem\np.b-left: 4. Work smooth, easy, fun to building it the best\np.b-left: 5. You can wait all your life before you finally build it [grow patience]. Launch in your family first, then take your friends on board, later colleagues and if you find your product helpful — \np.b-left: 6. Launch it.",

        "body": "h1: When in doubt do this !\np.note: It is a re-affirmation, blind trust, faith related post. I was down, maybe I lift my self up a little and vent out here.\np: It has been 3 years since I started to learn to code on Udemy. I have used a lot of twitter since then. Before that, facebook was my goto place to get hooked. I have also written a lot of blogs — I lost the count.\np: Today I was trying to make my weekly newsletter basic setup. My failures flashed back and I lost track of time. Misery  over ran me. And now, I am sitting in a clothing brand shop sofa — feeling worst. If the world can build these stores, why can’t I.\np: This is not the first time — feelings of failure over ran me. It has happened in the past and I always channeled my anger into a product.\np: If you are finding similar feelings of failure, misery and hopelessness. Immediately get into action — that you save yourself from drowning.\np.b-left: 1. Write down your feelings\np.b-left: 2. Look back and measure the distance you have travelled\np.b-left: 3. Get out and stop doing everything you were doing\nh3: 1 — Write down your feelings\np: Most great written scripts are, \"feelings written honestly\". Best songs are, anger channeled into words. Best dances are, emotions translated into movements. Best art works are, worst losses painted on paper.\np: So — it is ok to fail and express yourself into words. Express the bad[s] you are experiencing today. Bring your wrench, thirst and agony into action.\np: For me, the best action, closest to practicality, is this journal that I write everyday. If I could give you an advise, it is\np.bold: Start writing blogs and release your frustration to the world.\np: Slowly you will realise you will be craving for agony that you manage to write good.\nh3: 2 — Look back and see how far you have travelled\np: In the noise around us. Sitting under more lights and big domes you feel miserable. When your journey is somewhat similar to this brand’s journey — that is pinching you in your ears, it becomes difficult to handle losses. Envy over runs us.\np: I say, these mega successes around you, are noise to you. All brands grow from small steps of trusting your instincts. And all brands that took the easier path, are bound to hit their bottom.\np: You have travelled a lot. 3 years back, you couldn’t sit in peace, listen classic, pat yourself and stand on your own feet. 10 years back you were spending the time to somehow let it pass without bothering you. 20 years back you were stuck in a small town and you were a punching bag for your relatives.\np: Life was miserable and today you ate, laughed, focused and lived good.\np: It is not anybody’s greatness but yours own. You managed to survive the chaos of your life and still sail just fine.\np: If today is rough, it does not mean you did not run fast enough. It means, you needed some rough to keep you afloat. It is here to teach you something new today. It will benefit you tomorrow. And it will grow you into a stronger version of you.\nh3: 3 — Now, get out and stop doing everything you were doing\np: I am sitting in Khaadi, Noor Jehan songs in the background. People walking, opting, paying for their choices. In 30 minutes — nearly everything has turned around.\np: Had it been the same dull day inside my 2 room apartment, it would have been another wasted day.\np: Honestly, if pushing yourself into action does not help. Or if you are finding it hard to motivate yourself to keep walking straight — get out and change your surroundings.\np: Changing your state, gives your views new perspective.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Keep things simple in your life. Do not complicate simple stories into complicated words. Do not portray yourself bigger than what you are. Keep all things organic, real and straight. If you are a boring person to talk to, be the worst boring you can be. People will find your lousy talks fun.\np: Take small actions that reflect the real you. Failure, loss, sadness and ugliness is everybody’s life. If you show these early, if you lift curtain before everybody else, you will manage to spread courage before everybody else does.\np: Do humble stuff upfront. Look your problem in its face and show your kind of anger. Speak less but when spoken, speak like your urge is to speak. Do not act logical, sane and normal. Because normal is fake. Insane is childish, happy and real.",

        "body": "h1: Find your passion else you will die young\np.note: After a long day of work, I am now sitting — smiling — rolling — hitting keyboard and feeling happy. Nothing gave me the bump as coding for an hour gave just now. You got to feed your passion, else you will die young. My take on passion is simple. Read below 👇\nh3: So.. what is Passion ?\np: Passion is a rare commodity today. These days you do not find many people — passionate. Or, they have passion, but the un-necessary burden they put on themselves usually eats it away. Slowly they forget such a thing existed in their souls.\nYou got to feed passion, to feel passionate. Else you can not feel great.\np: Follow these 3 tricks to keep your passion alive :—\np.b-left: 1. Spare an hour when you are down to just pick up the shovel and start hitting\np.b-left: 2. Isolate yourself from the world and find your flow\np.b-left: 3. Look back and measure your steps — to reward yourself\nh3: 1 — Pick your shovel and hit the ground\np: There is no other way at hitting that Japanese Flow 'ikigai' but by picking up the shovel and hitting the ground hard. Hit your ground hard. Get muddy. Fall, Bend, Break and get lost in your work — the kind of work you love to do.\np: If you think, you will find the right time and you will get back to work. It is not going to happen. You will not find time and you will not be able to give your due time to what gives your life Fire. You got to pick the match box, take out the match stick and slide it down the phosphorus rug. There is no other way but to actually getting into DOING IT.\np: Next comes the attainment of Flow state.\nh3: 2 — Isolate yourself from the world around you\np: You see those miserable retards, laser focused on their laptop screens and does not know a train is about to over run them?\np: I am that guy. I get lost in my world. I forget — their existed people around me. I forget what happens in my email inbox, or what person texts me, or what bomb blew the world 4 days back. I just disappear, sitting in the crowd. And to be honest, I love it!\np: This is called the Flow state. You got to taste it. It is fun, alive, firely and uni-directional. You get into this state and beat your drums. You wake people up and you dance in your own mystical world.\np: Amazingly, I have realised over period; the flow state doesn’t demand attention, validation or money. It does not even ask for a successful product to keep you motivated. It demands nothing, but your will to get into it. After you slide your soul into this state — time ceases, air slides down your nostrils and your eyes are simmering the light. You fly.\np: I would say, with passion, isolation becomes easy. The crowd stops bothering you.\nh3: 3 — Look back and measure your steps\np: It is important you remember the lazy, old, late up mornings today. I used to wake up late. I used to smoke a lot. I used to live depressed. And I lived a life in a constant fear. Straight 10 years, I looked for a chance to grab the next cigarette. I tried to clean my taste bugs with harder drink to make sure I feel the smoke. I failed to find Fun and I lived a miserable life. Hate it!\np: Over period, I have realised that looking back at those bad times, gives me strength. It helps me feed my passion. The anger of wasting all those precious years, only motivates me to get into my passion state even quicker.\np: You have got to measure your steps. You were a bad person yesterday and you have walked some meters ahead in your life. If you can’t find love in the distance you covered, you need to look deeper. Your journey to making your today possible, is worth it. \nh3: Conclusion\np: If you have not yet started your journey. Or if you have not yet discovered your passion. You are not late. Start 30 days challenge. Print 30 days boxes on a paper. Hang it in your home. Promise yourself, no more wasting your time. And no more living a life in hell.\np: You will feel the buzz right now. Your repentance will eat your guilt away. You will feel depth in your smile. Your talk will become loud. You will get into writing your plans immediately. \np: Life will become so much colorful right now.\np: We are living in year 2020, and if you do not get rich tomorrow, honestly it is no body’s fault. Pin it to your chest — it is your Fault. You living a life of poverty, is your own fault. ",

        "body": "h1: What is Failure...\np.note: The best people I have met in my life — failed the best. It is important we stay close to reality and make ourself ok with repeated failures.\np: No body reads my blogs. No one attends my meetups. Ok none is not zero here. It is 10 to 20 people every month. But not where I place the quality of my events. I want it to be in Millions.\np: Social media promotes “success”. Mentors talk of “success”. Parents and bosses talk of “success”. But — no one talks about the number of Failures it takes to reach the success.\np.quote: Success is actually, one mishit on Failure.\np: Someday when you don’t fail — you succeed. It is worthless to chase success when it is so rare.\nh3: What is Worthy if it is not Chasing Success?\np: It is chasing Failures with zeal, passion and continuity. Building motion to accept it. Growing guts to smile to your humiliations. Standing straight. Taking hits. But collapsing head on.\np: In today’s world filled with envy, glamour and shine — the only thing we can do good to keep us moving good is having the will to fall.\nh3: But… Is Failing Easy?\np: No. It requires focus, silence, a belief to keep us steadfast in pursuing our goals. It is not easy. That is why most among us rarely want to fail.\np: We do not want to fail in our teenage, our adulthood or far ahead in our life. But when the time is over — we fail bad on our death bed.\np: Just want to not - fail does not change anything. If you keep  holding to compromises — you are destined to failure. \np: Teenagers always have ego. In this part of life, they do not bend to accept their losses.\np: Adults are always correct, but they are not willing to take the jumps.\np: Elders are always convinced their life lessons were right, but they do not let their children take another route.\np: — all their life, people do not take measures to risk, learn or correct themselves. This leads to their entire social structure collapsing.\nh3: How it is going to impact us ?\np: Consider most among us have started our personal struggles. Some have started teaching kids online, some have opened a shop at home, some are doing taxi in the evening.\np: If we all start doing something of our own, we will start circulating our incomes / bank money / savings. We will be rolling some kick ass campaigns, giving out jobs, learning from our failures; but promoting a Fun way of living in our own neighbourhood.\np: It will give our kids a direction, our elders a topic to discuss with their kids. Such that our girls will be protected. Our priorities will change at once.\np: Entrepreneurial spirit, engulfs a life style of its own. You start playing risky but start turning small amount of money heaps of money. It gives colors to our life. With good colors — we make a dull society into a wonderful country.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Failure is a destination. It is not supposed to worry us in these times. When we have not taken the first step — we can not look at what is on the other side of the Finish Line. \np: Become a great athlete, that takes the start and does not look back. That falls mid way, gets a foot injury or a broken knee; but still holds on to running forward.\np: Failures are evident in all kinds of journeys. These are colorful avenues in our life. Without failures, we can not excel, can not learn and can not grow. \np.bold: Failures, paint our lives with the best stories to tell.",

        "body": "h1: Fight for what is yours — else you will lose what is yours\np.note: How do we fight, when the opponent is a proven giant? It is a hard question to answer. Most compromise, or give up, or stand down, but do you — when you are punched in your face?\np: In Pakistan, under and developing countries of the world, we have some bad habits. Some bad rituals. Some bad traditions that keep us at our low.\np: There is a class system. Then there is professional hierarchy. Then there is elder and junior gap. Then there is shyness. And nearly we are all dealing with the inner fear.\np: So many layers in our people’s minds, makes it difficult for them to raise a finger, to claim what is rightfully theirs.\np: My younger brother got imprisoned yesterday, in Canada. I told him to take up the batons and hit back strong.\np: I have been fined over not wearing a mask by my bosses and it is creeping me out.\nh3: 1 — Be brave and claim your grounds\np: I lived a life of fear my entire childhood and early adulthood. Since 2 years, I am taking my fights head on and I am getting richer.\np: I now drive a 2.5 Million Car. I own the entire lineup of Apple products. Next add on is security cameras. I am living a million times richer life than I lived nearly 2 years ago.\np: My life has turned around, literally. My brother, who got into a policing conflict yesterday, did not lose his calm for a moment.\np: If you want to get rich in wealth, or get bigger in life, or seek depth in your smiles — be brave and claim your grounds. \np: No one is going to stand for you, not your mother, not your father, if you do not stand up for what is rightfully yours. The moment you stop fighting, that same moment you start losing. If you did not start it — do not stop fighting.\nh3: 2 — Fight does not mean — throwing punches or inciting violence\np: If you want to really win the game of your life. You got to grow patience.\np: I was imprisoned first time over medical grounds. I lost my calm and I therefore, lost the grace in my fight. It did not let me win and I lost the honour.\np: The second time, I imprisoned myself up — surrendered myself — gave patience a chance. And in near over 2 months I got back my profession, my honor and my grace.\np: If you get angry in your fight, honestly, you do not win. You lose the moment you enter the ring.\np: If you stay patient, humble and available — you wait for the enemy to make a mistake. Only after it, you get a chance to make a long time win.\nh3: 3 — Hold on to the truth , no matter how tough it gets\np: This is the only key to winning. You are not for sale. You are not ok with a tiny compromise. You can not walk with your head high — if you do not claim what you so blindly believe.\np: Your talks are meant to resonate with your actions. Your fights are meant to speak up for you. The people who put trust in you, honor you, need you to stand up for them.\np: It is so easy to give up on tiny eroded bits. Every one convinces you to — COMPROMISE. Society convinces you to let it go. Your relatives, friends and inner self talks you down — that you stop now. That you do not harm yourself. That you stop hitting the walls. That you live in the confined boundaries. That you do not disrupt our norms and values.\np: But it is nothing but smoke — meant to be faded out. You can not let go the small shudders, thuds and snubs. You just can’t bow down and let the power eluded goons over run you. You have truth. You have your honor. This is enough to keep you afloat, filled and happy. Your honor, achieved after bad failures, is something no body can snatch from you. The mark of your beating are going to stay here until you are lowered into your grave.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Brothers and sisters, you are precious beings. You are not meant to be considered a particle in the dust. You have your honor, values and principles that no-body is allowed to crush. If you give others a chance to talk to you, or if you give your salute to somebody because you respect them, it does not mean they got a ticket to mock you or ridicule you.\np: Nobody in the world, can snatch away from you, your freedom. Nobody can humiliate you. Nobody can talk you down. Not governments, not judges, not riches and not your family.\np: You are born free. And you will die free. If you do not claim this freedom yourself — none in this world is going to claim it for you.\np: Live humble, have patience, talk sober, smile good — but when they lower you — roar good, act loud, look fierce and walk bold. Now is not the time to COMPROMISE. Now is the time to, FIGHT.",

        "body": "h1: 3 things you can do today — to get rich tomorrow\np.note: There is a bubble around us that keeps us ok with comforting ideas. That it is ok to to live a life of misery and normalcy. You are the least, being paid to feed your family and fuel your car.\np: Let us not fool / convince / lie to ourselves that life is ok this way.\np: We are not ok with miserable, normal and 9 to 5 boring work routine.\np.bold: We need a change.\np: We need to put fake illusions — if that is what it takes — to keep us on our toes.\np: We need to redraw our life plan ourselves and get filthy RICH.\nh3: 1 — Buy a thing and sell it\np: Before we alienate money and give it bad names, let’s stick to reality. We need money to pay our bills. We need it to gain financial freedom. And we definitely need it to become richer.\np: So, what is stopping you from investing yourself into money?\np.bold: Nothing !\np: Buy something awkward, weird, bad, crazy, and put it online — to sell it.\np: Act honest, tell people the advantages this thing has.  Convince them through kindness and honesty, and get rid of it.\np: There is no other way of making money, but by selling the stuff you do not need.\np: Sell things, buy them as you find its demand, and get back to selling them. Keep iterating it, until you become profitable and win your freedom.\nh3: 2 — Do 1 thing everyday that brings you out of your comfort zone\np: Pomodoro App — download it. It is 25 minutes of focus sprint followed by 5 minutes of rest break. You can use 3 to 4 sessions everyday to keep you in your productive zone. Make this app; your friend, companion and a go-to door to get growing.\np: Inside our comfort zone — we do not create things that make us proud. \np: You got to get to your work, to make things work for you. You got to bring yourself out of your comfort zone, and you got to get yourself into some kind of Action. You got to build momentum. Else you do not see the results.\np: Challenging yourself for an hour or two everyday, makes you rich in gratefulness, commitment and happiness.\nh3: 3 — Oblige yourself to keep yourself committed\np: It is difficult for me to keep growing a month or 2, down this beautiful road of success. Commitments had been tough my entire life. I was not living a committed life. And I was not able to grow rich in any area of my Life.\np: But, this year, I am organising meetups. Next month it is our 10th chapter. I am going negative in revenue.\np: You can say, how does my losses of money make me a specialist in Growing-Rich-Field.\np: Well, it does! if you look deeper : —\np: 9 meetups in 9 months with a blog post nearly everyday, is my definition of being rich.\nh3: Lesson\np: You do not get rich, if you are lousy, slow or boring most of your days. You got to show up on your committed promises. Else you lose trust and therefore you lose your customers.\nPublic interactions, real life obligations and small 1 hour face to face interviews is how I keep my self sticking to my hobbies. If it had not been for the people I have made promises with, I would have drowned into the junk of criticism and harassment.\nPeople, are your best bet, to keep you growing. You make your promises with them, you sit with them, you create your habits as a team. And slowly the team work will make you climb the ladders of successes.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Many gurus, counsellors and religious figures promote happiness-without-money. I agree, happiness and money are two different domains.\np: But, I am unable to find a way to maintain the state of happiness without good financial freedom.\np: We need to stay afloat in this society, else we drown. We do not sail, if we fail to pay our bills, the car maintenance or the taxes. We need to make money to survive in this City.\np: Money, is a by product of a life good lived. And happiness, is a byproduct of money good earned.\np: Build habits, grow rich and get happy.",

        "body": "h1: Good coding habits\np.note: Sadaf is my only student I am teaching to code these days. I am learning a lot, while teaching her. How do we keep it good and manageable even when it has now turned into a thousands of lines of code? Let’s discover today!\np: I have been writing nodejs and front end for over 3 years. At some point — it all stops working. Code gets stupidly lengthy and multi branched. You want to fix a simple route to filter the data. You try to find the appropriate route where you can plug the new feature inside — and it becomes a mess. Because you did not give due thinking into writing it the first time, now it is not modular enough and any new feature is only going to make it difficult to manage.\np: All my projects have expired due to my bad coding habits. Only because I complicated real simple things.\nh3: For example\np.b-left: Forms never followed their natural submit. I always interrupted them using prevent defaults () in javascript.\np.b-left: Excessive ajax to make meaningless interactions.\np.b-left: Doing multiple things on a single html page.\np.b-left: Building front end before the backend.\np.b-left: Coding preceded with no thinking.\np.b-left: Mongoose using multiple functions under 1 statement to make myself look cool [ to no one ] : — e.g findOneAndUpdate with { upsert: true } option embedded.\np.b-left: If you are failing in building a proper functioning product — read this article carefully.\nh3: 1 — Draw your plan\np: If you have an idea, or a multi billion dollar proposal, or your life depends on it. I would suggest WAIT. Absorb this idea. Let it settle in your head 2 to 3 days.\np: All websites are complicated and thorough planning makes these complicated things, Simple. For example, every time I built a product it needed a Sign Up functionality.\np: Sign Up page is the entry point where you get your earnings. It is meant to work properly for your product to churn properly.\np: Sign Up, is not alone. It needs a Sign in Form. And Sign in is not alone. It needs a forgot Password Form. And forgot Password, needs a method to send you 4 digits verification code. This is not it. You got to make a separate Premium portion — where people signing up should be able to pay you.\nIf you get to hitting keyboards out of the box, you get stuck and finally lose track of why you started it.\np: I strongly suggest, if you want to deliver a quality product, make a sober sign up system. That gets money into your account in the fewest possible clicks.\np: Draw your plan on a white blank paper. Write down the exact hierarchy of actions needed to build the system. Use good hand writing that is referable a month later.\np: Very few people have made a good sign up / in system. Facebook did it right and it blew up. Apple did it right, on there Macs. Google did it right on OAUTH [ Sign in with Google ] and finally managed to earn. Good platforms make you sign up right up, as you reach their landing page, in the fewest clicks and reward you with a system built on scalable architecture.\nIf you get sign in / up / payment methods right, you have completed 20 to 30 % of your product.\nh3: 2 — Simple is the best approach\np.b-left: Do not make CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) process difficult. Stick to CRUD methods to manage data in database.\np.b-left: Do not start writing the front end at the start. Design front end, but code back end first.\np.b-left: Keep the excitement alive. Make small achieveable milestones to cross everyday. \np: In today's hype, almost everyone is skipping the basic guidelines. Repeatedly compromising the quality and later developing a habit of writing bad code.\np: Coding is not a skill, if it is not written thoughtfully. It turns into a mess, which you do not want to see happening with your product in the future.\nh3: 3 — Do not jumble up the File System\np: You must have seen a pile of files belonging to developers’ project directory. Each method falls into a separate file. Model Schemas go elsewhere. Configurations are pulled out in a separate file. And so much of baseline code — that could have fallen into 1 x file, shifts to a number of files.\np.bold: This is wrong approach.\np: Multiple files cause excessive confusion. Specially, when you are an amateur or a novice developer.\np: Write everything in 1 file.\nh3: For example I am writing nodejs: —\np: My html files are “.hbs” files and they go at one place in “views” directory.\np: My backend file is one “index.js” file and it resides at only one place.\np: There is nothing that is out of my reach when I am handling backend. The images need a DELETE route? I search “image” and all of it is here right in front of me. Layered, beautifully placed with its neighbouring routes.\np: Repeatedly looking at same lines of codes, keeps things familiar. And slowly, the entire layout, wires itself to our natural way of thinking.\np: If a code breaks or a route malfunctions, I have only 1 file to fix. There are no back and forth jumps to find the bug. No getting familiar with the code first. And it is all now easy. Next cool addition, next middleware authentication or building a nice Cart, that works without bugs, becomes as clean as the rest of your back end.\nh3: Conclusion\np: Writing clean code, giving simple routes, doing one-thing-at-one-time approach and understanding before getting into building — are all things that is keeping writing code fun, for me.\np: If you do not love what you are building, you might find some customers but you won’t be able to maintain its quality.\nSlowly, things will start breaking apart, and you will be wanting to give up. At that point — you will need to rewrite all the bad lines of code. You might dump existing code and restart.\np: I seriously wish, in my early days somebody could have lectured me on it, \"it has to be simple and linear to Work\". I would not have wasted past 3 years of building crazy stupid projects.\np: Be very conscious of your decisions while you are building it. Slowly you will build trust over your project and it will get easier to improve or refine. Embedding new features will become easier. And you will at once know; if your customers are asking too much or they indeed need it.",

        "body": "h1: How do we make our Mosques, Churches, Synagogue and Temples impactful\np.note: I am a Muslim, so, we have mosques. Some of us are Christians so some have churches. And some hindus, so, some among us go to temples. We have existing community centres in our towns, that can turn our world around — only after we start utilising these places.\np: I will try to keep it simple — baby steps. If we follow these simple and easy steps, we can turn things around.\np: I will be calling all our religious places \"community centres\". Because, initially all these centres were built for the betterment of our society.\nh3: 1 — Be a good host\np.bold: You know which hotel dominates the city?\np: One, that offers good rooms at affordable prices. Hotels, are flourishing in today’s economy but not our churches. What is the reason?\np: Because churches are not hotels, and they are meant to pray, meditate, confess and go lost back in the world?\np: In fact, the true reason our religious institutions are failing — these places are not providing much value to its visitors. Even when visitors are paying their dues in the shape of donations / charity works, still religions are fading out.\np: Tinder apps, Friends with Benefits and dating has become a new norm. Why ??\np: Because Sex is Fun. And today’s religion is opposite of Fun.\nStart contacting your honest businesses and prepare a list. Make negotiations with them. Get to terms and prepare discount vouchers. Take vouchers from the hotels. And, suggest travellers the best hotel in your town.\np: People reaching hotel with your voucher gets a discount. Circulate this message around\np: “GET A DISCOUNT FOR STAY AT HILTON HOTEL FROM SAINT PETER CHURCH”\np: As people arrive, offer them tea. Give them a walk through of your place. Understand their problem. Let them take shower. And give them the voucher for a night stay at HILTON. It can be done, with your local Gymnasium, or a your local beauty parlour.\np: Unless we make our religious institutes colourful — I and people like you, are not going to turn towards them. If you are elder of your town, it is your responsibility to lead the town through these community centres.\np: And if you can’t lead your town, you need to give way to the teenagers / youngsters / entrepreneurs to make them colourful for you.\nh3: 2 — Listen to an issue everyday\np: I do not know about UK or USA. But in Pakistan, poverty is a problem. With poverty, comes its consequences. Lawlessness, health related issues, child labour and weaker civil infrastructure.\np: Our mosques are not listening to our problems. As we go there, we do not find an ear — to LISTEN to us.\np: We can become this ear ourselves. And start sitting in the mosque everyday after noon prayer.\np: We can make the announcement in our community that any one feeling left out of what he feels is rightfully his / hers, can come to the mosque and talk to us. We will not solve the problem. We will only listen to you and try to feel the pain — you are going through.\np: Make it a habit, of sitting in the mosque, and let people talk to you.\np: You listen to them, like it is your job, and give compassion. Compassion gives life fire, power and energy.\np: When people share their problem with you, knowing you are hearing them — they feel compassioned.\nh3: 3 — Teach one Skill\np: I am a web developer. I also arrange monthly meetups. And like now, I write an article everyday [ almost ]. My life has turned around. I was a boring person, not fun and a typical office guy.\np: Skill learning has lifted my living. I am richer now and I am somehow contributing to my town.\np: Instead of preaching boring religious books to our kids, we can teach them worldly skills.\np: We can arrange a skilled worker who can knit good leather. Give him a studio space in the temple. And ask him to teach our kids to stitch leather.\np: As you start it, you will be able to write a course curriculum around it. Make a flier, or a quick advertisement card, and circulate it through your local newspaper delivery guy. \np: People will start finding fun. They will grow their skills, establish their earnings and slowly, they will start understanding the message hidden underneath our religious centres.\nh3: Conclusion\np: We are divided today. Divided in siblings, relationships, sects, casts, ranks and religions.\np: I am a strong preacher of establishing co-working spaces around our towns. Places like Apple Stores around the world, where they teach photography to visitors for an hour or two everyday.\np: But — these places, the Apple Stores in the shape of our religious centres, are already there. We have so many co-working spaces around us, only need is we lit them up. \np: Religiously speaking, from Quranic point of view, it is not our job to evaluate who goes to hell or heaven. <b>Our job is to make people’s life easy</b>.\np: With religious discrimination, we instead of making it easy, are making it harder.\np: I feel, if we teenagers; gather, team up, and start working on these lines / idea — we will start having an impact on all bad things that huant us today.",

        "body": "h1: Beautify your workspace to enhance your productivity\np.note: Over a period of nearly 3 years of my development career, the most important thing I have learnt is establishing a minimal yet beautiful office space. If it is not good, you can not work good. Pin it somewhere prominent.\nimg: office-space-536.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Home Office by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@benchaccounting?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\" target=_blank>Bench Accounting</a>\np: Below are the guidelines to make sure you stay meaningful even when you are hours into hitting keyboard and pushing content. Excessive coding / design / writing / painting becomes dull at some point. It is a myth <b>“you can not produce good content when you are hours down into creating one”</b> — totally WRONG !\np: You can publish highest quality content — even after hours of hard work — if you lift the ambience of your space, fix your posture a little and declutter your surroundings.\np: This is a broader view but to be precise read below.\nh3: 1 — Do not lose important things\np: As you sit longer, weird things start happening with your focus. Pomodoro recommends we take a 15 to 20 minutes break after 4 sessions of 25 minutes. That means, we get up, move around, make coffee and slide it down.\np: All these things related to moving around requires availability of things. If you can get up, move easily and find the coffee at the same place you left yesterday, that means you have a rather better work space.\np: For me it was a Problem; Losing things that I placed very carefully around my work desk. Over period, I realised, it is a distraction that leads to frustration. So.. I try to never lose my stuff for that 15 to 20 minutes pomodoro break. \nh3: 2 — Create space for your arms, elbows and bums\np: Sitting posture is an important factor to protect you from back pain, distractions and wet eyes. Great sitting posture is \"Great\". But how exactly do we have the greatness while sitting laser focused on our black screen? Let’s find out !\nimg: sitting-posture-536.jpg\np.text-center.caption: How to sit on your desk — Photo drawn by me 😁\np: Keep your elbows just around the corner of the desk. That you do not move them freely. Moving elbows means your hands are moving un-necessarily too much. Let your hands do the work. While protecting any budge on your elbows. \np: The rest of the arm needs clean space. So make sure you keep your desk clean, keyboard cleaner, cosier and feel-good texture. You only have a keyboard and a mouse on your desk. Longer hours of work demand you give them due attention. These items are important elements. While you are at your work — you simply can’t let anything else touch these things. No glass of water, no tissue paper, no white paper and no pencil. Keep the clutter away from your keyboard and mouse.\np: The last important is the choice of chair that keeps your bums at their rightful place. You can not afford a hard bottom chair, or a straight bench, or any thing too cozy. Work time is meant to be purely related to Work. Keep your bums at good height that you can keep your elbows pinned to your desk corner and your keyboard is now well in your reach.\np: Keep your table low enough that you can comfortably move your arms around over it. Do not lower it too much, that your elbows fail to touch the table. Find the mid spot to make sure you do not get tired feeling uncomfortable.\nh3: 3 — Remove clutter\np: I believe good things happen in <b>home office</b>. Not the work office or a co-working space office. If your home office, looks and feels great you really do not feel a need to go somewhere else and create things. Keep your home office fun. Because, this is your home, the awesome place to feel good.\np: Find minimalistic furniture, try to lay wood on floor, that your feet rubbing against it makes you feel good. Keep warm lights near the desk but out of reach of your eyes. Too much warmth, slowly start hurting your eyes. Hang a big size TV, if you can afford. The office chair should be able to serve multiple purposes. \np.b-left: You should be able to work on your desk sitting here.\np.b-left: A slight revolve should let you watch NETFLIX.\np.b-left: And another turn should let your discuss ideas — with mates sitting back on your sofas.\np: This is your office chair. It is meant to reflect the kind of destination you are aiming at (everyday of your life). After a hard day at work, nice home-office will make you feel good. You will be attracted towards your creative work space. Not feel dull and can easily beat procrastination. \nh3: Conclusion\np: I love Life related words. To be honest, it all comes down to good mood, positive thoughts and meaningful smiles.\np: All good people, slowly grow the habit of making their work spaces, their homes, their galleries, lounges and lawns — meaningful. It does not take ample money to declutter our life. Remove excessive noise, spice and gossip. It only needs discipline.\np: If you want to make sure you stay productive, on track, your customers love your work and you manage to work in a repeated state of flow, embrace discipline.\np: You will be becoming a professional in what you are doing, in a matter of days instead of months.",

        "body": "h1: What is Life like after you Quit Internet intake ?\np.note: I have been living clean of internet for over 2 months now. No whatsapp, telegram, facebook, Twitter or Emails.\nimg: get-social-537.jpg\np.text-center.caption: Get Social by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kcurtis113?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\" target=_blank>Kevin Curtis\np: Deleted all internet apps from my phone. And I drove my car off to Northern Pakistan. We camped, cooked tea under snow peaked cliffs sitting beside the rapid water streams. \np: I used to tell my self - I am a Failure. I was deeply obsessed about social feedback, (follow counts on twitter and likes on facebook). My success definition revolved around “am I growing in winning attention?\" Tweet Analytics measured the quality of my life even when I was away. Excessive envy and a lot of confusions. I lacked proper mission. I was Tired. \np: When I got back, clear headed and more focused than before. I dodged social media. Did some searching for our next event. Spread our next event’s word around. And that was, it. Internet shuts down. Emails disappears. In nearly half an hour to one hour, I stop existing on internet.\np: After I detached myself from Internet, things became much normal. Conversations shifted to social interactions. Friends became real. Occasional gatherings started happening. In real — I am back on earth from virtual cloud.\np: You gain 3 things back — when you take back the control of your life from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and News Channels: —\nh3: 1 — Absolute Focus\np: I just did a 2 mile run. Did some relaxing exercises. Sitting on a bench. Headphones On. Rain ☔️ in the background. Badly sweating. It is morning. I am doing what I love — Writing. \np: To make sure, Internet do not get in my way, I use my phone's notes App. Fix some mistakes and publish it.\np: It feels nice. 2 months back — while internet was eating on my focus, I stopped writing and disappeared.\np: In a month’s silence, I found staying off-grid is the only way to grow and contribute. Good things started happening. And I am now mostly sitting pumped for the next task in my list. \np: Internet mostly propagates a feeling that things are not right. The amount and energy we put in, we are still feeling the void. One more fix here, another touch there. And we are in a constant run to compete with the entire internet giant. Which is never possible. It is tiresome and makes us feel inferior.\np: If I am writing everyday, I am already successful. Because I love it. And It makes me feel Alive. We build focus once we stop competing. We start creating — once we stop listening.\nh3: 2 — Healthy Relationships\np: As you disappear, only people who need you, find you. You find people, who appreciate your work. After quitting the internet and phone, you create a filter that purifies FACEBOOK 999 Friends illusion. And shows you the under ~ 10 x friends that really matter to you.\np: You build a bond with these important people. You talk among them. Some times have dinner with them. Some days teach them to code. Some times fight with them. But you get back to the Original World. Where only people, who did not envy you, sit with you. \np: It feels great to sit in the new real world. The presence of sincere friends feels great. Today I am sitting and laughing with them. \nh3: 3 — Good Sleep\np: One of the most important ingredient towards living a happy life is <b>Sleep</b>. Almost everyone underestimates its importance.\nIf you sleep good — you are good.\np: The “good” is all things that you want to see fixed in your life. If you are addicted, sleep good. If you are constantly in a fight with your colleagues, sleep. If you can’t get rid of a discomforting thought, sleep.\np: There are various strategies to improve our performance. Chose which works best for you. But make sure you are taking enough rest that keeps you pumped and happy. Anything that spoils your routine, is damaging to your success. Sleep is one hurdle I found we mostly undervalue. Gradually the need builds and we end up compromising our work ethics / quality and flow states. \nh3: Conclusion\np: That shiny product we create, compromising our immediate social life, is an illusion.\np: If you want to work everyday on your Life mission. The first thing you got to find is — LIFE MISSION. It is that simple.\np.b-left: How do you find it?\np: <b> By staying away from the noise and thinking about your LIFE </b>. Internet is that noise that constantly bangs in your head, “you are wrong”.\np.b-left: I say — Shut it for once.\np: Say to its face… No ! You are Wrong. I am Right. I love what I do.

        "body": "h1: My productivity Ad Ons\np.note: If you are into productivity seeking mission, you will be knowing — the run itself is tiring at times. You want to regain the focus but fail to find it — even though you have tried all the ingredients. You can try these tips to get back on board to building your amazing world around you.\np: The best strategy is always getting to Work. With out channeling your anger, frustration, and crib towards the betterment of the world, it is not possible you keep your momentum going. You got to channel your thoughts and worries into something. This demands patience, silence and sobriety.\np: Slowly we all grow into amazing people. Things start to fall into their places. We know, things are not usually so bad, as they feel when they are thrown at us. Life seems normal as we walk few steps down the muddy road.\np: We still need to make sure we are going in the right direction even when everyone tells us we are going right.\np: How do we make sure peoples’-praise does not slow us down? Let’s find out !\nh3: 1 — Cook one meal of the Day\np: I saw this photo on Pinterest and I told myself — it is weird. How cooking can increase our productivity meter. But, honestly, as I made the breakfast, the egg fried and mayonnaise with cucumber and tomato — things turned out quite well.\np: It is a different domain. Away from my computer screen. No algorithms, no designs, no logics and no typing. While you get to embrace the kitchen of your house, you do not only cook, you also clean the marble shelves. You make sure the dishes are cleaned. You also ensure nothing rots inside those windows nets and it all improves your overall sense of cleanliness.\np: Cooking helps. You will learn a lot of things. Not related to programming, or design, or better sentence construction — but it is unique and gives you a different perspective to your life.\np: We are people who literally belong to the woods, jungle and river streams. Technology has taken us away from our roots. And slowly the bad habits of excessive peeking into light emitting screens is only piling up frustration in our brains.\np: We need to make sure, our frustration does not prove counterproductive. And for that I resort to cooking. You can find your love in gardening, or hiking or anything that keeps you away from your computer screen for some part of the day.\nh3: 2 — Listen to a podcast where people speak like you want to speak\np: We all are what we think. And what we think, is what we take inside our brain. Podcast is this amazing product of our new era — we can listen to anybody anywhere in the world, while sweating hard on our jogging tracks.\np: I do it while I am jogging on the track. While I am sweating hard and I can feel the pain in my legs. Yep.. I get tired after few sprints. But at the same moment — the podcasts somehow amplify my brain power. I feel might, unstoppable, and powerful after I am done with the morning run.\np: The morning run is there, everyone does it. And most people also work out in the Gyms. I am not promoting going onto the track here. It is not the exertion that boosts my motivation levels.\np: I listen to people of ladybugs and Indie hackers these days. Even when their words swing past my brain and I do not manage to absorb much — they leave an impression that I carry along the whole day. I feel I am sitting with people of these thoughts, who are contributing to the world and I am a part of them.\np: If you want to contribute, you got to surround yourself with people who are contributing. If you are from Pakistan, where you do not find many people willing to contribute, you can hook yourself to these podcasts for 30 to 45 minutes a day and get back to feeling great.\np: It helps us avoid gossipy conversations, people oriented talks and spicy morning shows. We start entertaining our brain the way we want. Not the way our media outlets, news agencies and society wants.\nh3: 3 — Relax\np: I know it is already in your check list. If you are burning out quite often you know the right way to get out of the burnt is “Relax”.\np: I will just tell you — it is the right thing you are doing there. Relax ! Have a great time while you are sitting on your cozy sofa, listen to the bird sounds, put on airplane light stoppers, and go lost in your illusionary world.\np: I try to put myself at an imaginary place where I want to see myself when I am old — living in a cottage, away in a jungle and I am rich. It feels good. It helps me distract myself from the most crazy, absurd and abnormal thoughts = I am losing my time.\np: My time never goes wasted having a chilling time with my own thoughts. It is not success I am thinking about, neither failures, nor fights and no worries. I try to get lost into my own private world for some time everyday.\nh3: Conclusion\np: These are important times we are living in. Politicians are unable to control us. Rich guys are not our bosses. Kings are out of the business. Markets that prove their mettle, are flourishing. Internet has lowered the Big Certifications demands. Kids can do job even if they are under fifteen. Things are really turning around with technology. \np: While technology is proving helpful — it is proving catastrophic to closed minds. Excessive intake of music, pornography, drugs, and losing the instincts to differentiate wrongs from the rights, is giving some of us a dopamine Kick. It is literally taking lives of some of our people. \np: If we are able to think right, even when these crazy bad things are bombarded at us — it puts a responsibility of saving these people, right above on our shoulders.\np: Not all people are as productive as you are. Not all are able to take the control and drive their lives out of misery like you managed to drive yourself out.\np: I say — take this responsibility. Stay motivated not because you need success, but because internet is a wonderful thing and you can prove your life to be gigantically meaningful while building something useful.\np: Stay happy, stay motivated, stay growing, stay fun, even when you get tired doing it — do it for the lost kids in the far world...\np.note: You can join our mission of building a Productive Global Work Space by joining our community at techshek.io.",

And all the mercy we find in the world is just the 1th of his 99 parts of mercifulness.\np: After Musa (as) saw his people prostrating an animal, people decided to go to Mount tur and seek Allah's forgiveness. As they reached the mount tur and asked Allah for not only forgiveness but undue privileges the people were all killed in an earthquake. However, Musa (as) prayed to Allah for their return, to which the nation was brought back to life. They were fed from the sky and a new reign of prosperity fell upon them. \np: Jews used to mock our Prophet and challenge his credibility. In the last verse of today's lesson, Allah taught our Prophet about the story of sabt (saturday) where Jews were forbidden to hunt. However, as their test, on Saturday, the shores got richer. More fish on the bank. Thus inciting them to hunt on Saturdays as well. \np: Our Prophet (PBUH) was mocked and belittled by Jews. They bragged about their own stories and hid their crimes. Quran uncovered their faces and thus they got weaker — ultimately diminished.",

Here, if we do not revert, repent and return to Allah (swt) and ask Him for forgiveness, He will put a small seed of hypocrisy in our hearts. We will start telling lies. We will start hiding our one side from the world. And we will slowly water the feed of sin until it grows into a plant. And then it turns into a tree and takes over the most part of our lives. We go completely blind. Here — Allah (swt) shuts His doors of hidayat and we die in this state. \np: Such people, find goodness hard. They find reasons to stay sinning, in spite of the marks sins leave upon us. They accept the temporary delight and lose the lasting successes. They compromise their relationships, their finances, life style and alter their version of success. Success for these people, is a failure in every sane eye. These people are mentioned in these verses — that they only end up hurting themselves. They lose and die in the same state they live their lives. And they are not worth the attention of the Prophet PBUH. \np: May Allah make us people, who Prophet PBUH finds pride in.. Amen",

Then I just grabbed my pen, a white paper, and started crushing my goals — labelling it Fun in my head !\np: Fun is when things are falling apart, you feel lazy, down and distressed. And then you revive all of it back to highly contagious, motivated and charming personality. You turn yourself into a giant, who can not be crushed or mocked at. Who is consistent and merciless. You put on a new robe where you out perform your limiting beliefs and patterns. You get out and become a contributor, an artist, a fighter and a warrior. This place you become your best version and here — you pat yourself. \"You did an amazing job turning your mid to low day, into an outstanding day\".\np: The closest we believe we are to controlling our mindset, through fun and attractive ways, the closest we are to bringing in positive changes we admire. It is ok to be bored at times, but for the sake of rewards we get after the boredom, is worth the wait.\np: Keep moving forward, even when low hits you. Remember, there is help on the road. You got to walk to road to grab a ride. Reaching the road, is your responsibility. Do it  — and change your life.",

They ran with their eyes closed. They had hit walls, had broken promises, had betrayed closed ones, and yet they did not opt the path of successes.

They will finally wish Death over Life. \np: Allah (swt) mentions the wrath for these people, who turned his Signs down today. \np: May Allah help us be among the righteous when we wake up in the life hereafter.

When you are rewarded, you are proud. But when a storm hits you — you bow down. When a message comes to you, you reject it. When a light is shown to you, you block it. When you are given an opportunity to return to the path, you walk away.  Why would you abuse My words?\np: Believers, do not worry. They won't accept Quran. They will say you are an illusionist or a poet. You wrote it yourself. They can't write one like it. They can't even act on it. They wanted world — I showered tremendous wealths upon them. I made them go farther from me. I made them lost in glory and momentous joy. \np: They are like darkness and you are light. They are blind and you see. They are deaf and you hear. They are about to fall in a pit of fire. And you are going to enter paradise, where you will stay forever.\np.note: This is summary of 2nd Ruku of Surah Hud.",

He asked them, to return to Allah, stop the sin, think and act with an intent to bring betterment to this world. But his people rejected him. Gave him names. Called him a liar. Somebody who is nobody and has nobody beside him. Only the few poor / the left out segments. These nobody's, they said, are too ignorant to understand the value of this world. \r\np: Nuh (as) had these few friends, who stood strong beside him. After Allah, he banked on them. While ridiculed he had a shelter, a friend, a small group of people who could show him safety. But to Nuh's people, these were too ignorant to talk wisdom. Too ignorant to understand what is life and how to live it. \r\np: His people, had gone farther in disobedience. They got tired of Nuh (as). Asked him to stop the arguments, reminders, calls. Just go back to your group and preach. Stop the noise. If at all, bring the punishment you talk about. But don't interrupt our business, life or norms.\r\np: We know the punishment was due on these people. These people are same as we are today. We know a punishment is near. Yet we shut the call. We continue to break the boundaries. Thinking the immediate gratification is far more in value than the distant reward.\r\np.note: May Allah (swt) bless us with enormous faith that we can understand His message and gather the reward of akhira..

Others mocked him — laughed at him — criticized him. Until there was no hope left, for his people to return to his call. \r\np: Nuh (as) prayed to Allah to destroy the deaf, blind and dumb. People who couldn't believe a punishment was near. People who excelled further. And further is the only way for people who can't see. \r\np: In the midst of hopelessness, a small group and a dispersed family, Allah (swt) ordered Nuh (as) to built an ark. He and his friends, started working on one. Gathered wood, found the spot and slowly started bringing a boat to life. The mockings grew. More people laughed. The resistance fueled the small group of Nuh (as) to go faster and harder. To keep building their ark — under an open sky, just for Allah (swt) gave you a small hint.\r\np: They listened to Allah (swt) under bleak rays of hope. With no end in sight, they kept moving, kept pinning the boards to the ark. And soon it came to life. \r\np: People first rejecting were fascinated by the unchallenged resolve of the lowly people, Nuh had with him. Yet they did not give an ear to the call. Yet Nuh's own son turned him down. His wife rejected him. And soon everything vanished. Soon Allah's order came. The skies hid behind dark clouds. Mountains drowned in water. And Earth stopped at becoming a home. \r\np: Water all around. Until the laughters stopped and mockings disappeared. Until the losers were shown the reality of life. Until it was all silent.. \r\np: So is the way, Quran teaches us — that we become the smaller group. Run the farthest in faith. Join the clan of people who not only enjoy their life in this world, but on their deaths, in graves and after the grave. The peace of meat, breathing, eating and seeing — is not it. There is more ahead of us. More than we can grasp. \r\nh3: Interesting takeaways\r\np.b-left: 1. Nuh's ark is considered near Mosul, Iraq. \r\np.b-left: 2. This was 4th Ruku of Surah Hud, we found a nice dua to add to our prayer list.\r\nimg: duasurahhud1037.jpg\r\np.caption.text-center: Surah Hud, Verse 47\r\np.note: May Allah (swt) make us from the believers who stay steadfast in our eman.

Hold for a moment. Look at the signs. The sky, the skin, the nails on your fingers, the flesh on your bones, and the world beneath you, and the life inside you. Hold on and ponder, there is so much to grab, and so much to find the purpose. Please open your eyes and return to be among the people who help people, stay truthful, act humble and become a source of light.\r\np: Corruption was at its peak. Small rewards and a lot of work. People were accustomed to live in slavery of their lords or their desires. The society had toppled in morale. Lack of sincerity and love for wealth had blindfolded these tribes. Couldn't look, think, feel or let go their hollow pride.\r\np: He said, else, you are doomed. This will not help you. All the security and safety you have gathered around you, is one wind storm away. But they, mocked him. Forgot him. And continued living the life of slavery. Allah (swt) sent one storm, and the strongest people in history vanished.

He forgives without looking at the weight of crime, the injustice, the lowly act you committed. He helps you stand back on your feet when the world lets you lose. He gives you courage, confidence, and love — you need when nobody is there to help you. He lets you breathe, eat and sleep. Lets you walk on His planet. Hides your weaknesses. Lifts your soul. And turns you into the giant of the people — He loves. \np: The window to greatness opens, when we put ourselves at His mercy. When we tone down our achievements, remember our sins, feel small and worry. Thereafter, we let the Greatness of Allah, surround us. The place where when given a small encouragement — makes us humble. Where we did not expect, He gave us, and we feel grateful. Where we did not claim our right, asked for our balance, or looked at our bigs and instead; kept our self small. Here, our religion finds us — weak, shattered — and gives us forgiveness.
