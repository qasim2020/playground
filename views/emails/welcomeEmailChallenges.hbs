">If I had to tell you that you can change your life in a moment â€” "NOW" was the perfect moment, when I am writing this email. I just had a low negative ingress of thoughts. It was a mega push to throw me in to negativity. But, here I am, 2 minutes later, sitting back on my desk and in peak productive state. The magic is states. We can change everything in our life, in a snap. All it needs is to understand how our brain works.</p>
